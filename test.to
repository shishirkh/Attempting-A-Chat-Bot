um, ok no. a hate crime can be 'any of various crimes (as assault or defacement of property) when motivated by hostility to the victim as a member of a group (as one based on color, creed, gender, or sexual orientation).' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar i believe you are thinking of hate speech, which is still different. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [read up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime)

Oh boy, here it goes again. The republicans drove this country in the ditch, nevermind that the Democrats voted with them the entire way. Nevermind that they voted for the war (Obama voted for continuing the war on many occasions himself, despite his chest thumping that he was outside of the senate when the first vote went down which somehow makes him better suited for presidency). Nevermind that they voted for the Patriot Act. Nevermind that they voted for FISA. Nevermind that they had majorities in both houses of congress for the last two years of the Bush presidency but still did every fucking thing the president wanted them to do (reupping for the war ring a bell?) Nevermind that the biggest cause of this financial meltdown was bank deregulation that happened under Clinton, without which the absurd financial products that caused the collapse could not have even existed. No, let us disregard that this was a truly bipartisan (if you can even call two corporate conservative parties distinct) effort to fuck it over and instead play our little game of red team versus blue team. Meanwhile they both represent the same corporate interests and you continue to lose out.

No, this is the english language. That is not how it works. They aren't equated, it is a list of adjectives. That is what the comma means. It doesn't mean you can put a 'therefore' between the words. It means you can put an 'and' before the words, or you could switch around the order of the words without changing the meaning of the sentence. It also means both words describe the noun independently; the sentence would be equally valid if you removed one of the words. newlinechar  newlinechar The post I replied to above is 100% wrong; quit trying to defend it.

According to the sources in her Wikipedia page the GOP spent $3 million on the 20006 race tipping the fund raising scales in her favor.  Once one becomes an incumbent one has the incumbency advantage and it becomes incredibly expensive to dislodge them from their seat unless redistricting eliminates their seat.

Wreak. Havoc. I'm not sure how one goes about reaping some havock, but I suppose the would've first had to sow it.  And while sowing havock, patiently tending the field, using some pro-Havock round-up, a little weeding (of mayhem, carnage, tears, and chaos) to produce a pure crop, eventually reaping havock does sound like a fun occupation, I don't think it's the one you were referring to.

Well I read the wikipedia wrong because of my presupposition that cold weather compromises the immune system, which a quick google search proved controversial. There's this (clearly for): newlinechar &gt; Cold weather compromises your immune system, your body's defense against viral and bacterial invaders. When your body is at rest, it manufactures white blood cells and other cells of the immune system to fight off potential diseases. When your body has to work double-time to heat your body in subfreezing weather, it is not making immune system cells. Instead, in the process of warming you your body lets its guard down just a bit. (Book called Bad Medicine, google the text and you'll find) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And there's this, which makes a distinction between going out without a jacket in cold weather (good) and lowering of the body temperature (bad). I don't entirely get this. newlinechar &gt; On the contrary, cold weather appears to activate the immune system, according to a study by the Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, says Dr. Belilovsky. 'Researchers examined the immunological responses to cold exposure and found that acute cold exposure, such as going outside without a jacket, actually appears to activate the immune system.' This occurs in part by increasing the levels of circulating norepinephrine, one of the body's hormones, which works as a natural decongestant.....Weather as an Indirect Cause of the Cold: While simply stepping outside in cold weather without a jacket doesn't cause a cold, hypothermia (the lowering of the body's core temperature) suppresses immunity, which can lead to colds. 'Most cold symptoms are produced by the body's immune system physically responding to the rhinovirus,' says Belilovsky. 'So, someone with a stronger immune system in the cold will produce more (mucus), while the one with the weaker immune system will sniffle longer, but less dramatically.' The person with the weaker immune system probably will have more complications, such as sinusitis or ear infections, Belilovsky adds. [Source](http://www.everydayhealth.com/cold-and-flu/colds-and-the-weather.aspx) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And then it gives another two ways cold weather can indirectly make you sick.

Well, first off I would challenge you to say why *you* think RPGs are not being made as often anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly Contra, Megaman, Gradius and games like them are considered 2d shooters.  To say there are no turn-based shooters is kind of silly, that changes the genre in a fundamental way.  Kinda like making a real-time RPG makes it more of a hack'n'slash than an RPG.  Turn-based Shooters are things like X-Com and Commandos, Tactical games. newlinechar  newlinechar I work for a game developing company and I have seen the budget projections for all kinds of titles.  RPGs cost more.  Might just be my company, and others can make them cheaper.  But your comment on the difficulty of Shooter Engines over RPG Engines strikes me as profoundly ignorant.  You've no idea what a modern RPG has to do to attract an audience.  Sure you can make it look like Wizardry or FF6 without much effort, but that won't sell to anyone but a few hardcore fans, not enough to tempt any developer trying to make money.  Sure, to say that shooters are more Graphically demanding is easy.  The damage calculations even a mediocre RPG deals with dwarf even the most sophisticated shooter. newlinechar  newlinechar My point, is that for any sales target (1000 units sold, 10,000 units, a million) a shooter or an action game will hit that target with a wider audience for less money than an RPG.
I don't know if its fair to call government nationalization libertarian in any sense of the word.
I have not even begun to adumbrate. newlinechar  newlinechar But really, I don't see why anyone but buddhists are eager to find equivocation between their cosmology with the constellation of thinking associated with naturalism.  Buddhists have a bloody history of oppression and anti-intellectualism.  Religious movements always try to incorporate into their doctrines anything that cannot be opposed.  That's been true since the Hellenes attempted to conflate Zeus with ontology at least.  Ontology implies nothing about Zeus, and non-theism implies nothing about Buddhism.

You may be surprised to find I am on the same page. I can feel my brainwaves as a physical sensation, I just tend not to use that kind of language to describe it because I assume it will invoke a natural response of 'yea right'. As far as cultivating sensitivity down to the cellular level, it seems quite concievable. Detecting sensation of other persons bodies is quite another story, but you are talking to the right person for sure. I would absolutely love to hear your theories, I am absolutely interested in the same sort of ideas and concepts.

I'm not defending anyone, I just wanted to point out that the government makes some concessions to big labor and some concessions to big business - however I think that its pretty obvious that the government acts first to defend the interests of those with property and assets, that is the people who are able to give the biggest campaign donations (at least when this is possible because of political apathy). newlinechar  newlinechar I'm pro the ability of workers to organize and fight against wage slavery.

Then replace stealing with, say, kidnapping and you get an example that *is* the case.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you are kidnapped, you are *very* likely to be murdered—to the point that I've heard self-defense experts say if someone has a gun on you and they're telling you to get into their car, you're better off doing *anything* you can to escape and risking the bullet right there. newlinechar  newlinechar But if someone has a gun on you and demands your valuables, you're better off passing them over than running away; there *isn't* much imperative for a thief to permanently silence you, since the punishment for murder is so much worse than the punishment for armed robbery.

False context metaphors my ass. Seriously, I don't get it.  I'm making no religious claims.  I simply stated what surrounding verses mean, and I've got several people bitching me out. No one is arguing against my assertion. Are they pornographic? Damn straight.  The surrounding verses are as explicit as 23:20, if not more so.  Nevertheless, it's a metaphor, as clearly pointed out earlier in the chapter. newlinechar  newlinechar Ezekiel 23:4 newlinechar 'The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.' newlinechar  newlinechar Ezekiel 23:11 clearly states that the woman in 23:20 is Oholibah. newlinechar  newlinechar The chapter is pretty slick and well put together.  Is the atheism subreddit here such a slave to group think that people can't admit to clever literary devices when it's in a religious tomb?

I think you're fine - programmers, I feel like, are only becoming more important. I'm graduating from college this year, and even in this shithole of an economy, a LOT of my CS major friends are still doing ok and are not only finding work, but good paying work, even. We're still figuring out how to automate things, and there will be only more and more demand for people who can program well.. even if you don't find work in CS, there are plenty of other opportunities that are afforded to CS majors (consulting and finance are huge!). Also, there are even opportunities in the biomedical sciences now that bioinformatics is taking off...

Perhaps that is Ford's quote, but there certainly was concern about the size of the federal government during the founding of our country.  If by size we're talking about powers and jurisdiction.  The constitution is quite clear about the powers of the federal government versus the powers of the states.  See federalists vs anti-federalists.  Here's a quote that is definitely Thomas Jefferson.   newlinechar   'The true theory of our Constitution is surely the wisest and best, that the States are independent as to everything within themselves, and united as to everything respecting foreign affairs. Let the General Government be reduced to foreign concerns only, and let our affairs be disentangled from those of all other nations, except as to commerce, which the merchants will manage the better, the more they are left free to manage for themselves, and our General Government may be reduced to a very simple organization, and a very inexpensive one; a few plain duties to be performed by a few servants.' newlinechar 
&gt; Sure, it has the potential to diminish the income of the state to some extent and could complement an actual revolution but I don't think just by depriving the government of some taxes you're going to bring down the armies. newlinechar  newlinechar I view it less in economic terms than in sociological terms.  It diminishes the average citizen's respect for and trust of government (which I obviously believe to be misguided anyway).  Agreed that it's not a total solution -- not even close.  But I do think it's a valid tactic.  Every time a politician or a politician's ally is outed as a hypocrite [smoking pot, screwing hookers] or corporate stooge [lengthening the term of copyright], it weakens this particular government (and, I'd like to think, government in general) that much further. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Also I agree about some system of parecon of social markets.

The greater literary position on that question is this: newlinechar The masters, Tolstoy, Hemingway, Balzac, Proust, and Faulkner, are considered masters because the reader can *trust* that every word, every characterization, every speck of ink split in order to craft the narrative is deliberate. So when the reader, with sufficient evidence, uncovers a certain aspect of a character, it is assumed that the author intended for it to be interpreted, to be considered, though not necessarily adopted as concrete truth.

In a word: Yes.  Even on the same hardware (assuming it's relatively modern -- Win7 is much better at taking advantage of the advancements that have developed over the past eight years).  If you use Windows, and haven't already tried it, I would strongly encourage you to do so.  You get the kernel improvements of Vista (and there were many) without many of the UI 'my-goodnes-I-want-to-pull-my-hair-outs'.  It's really what Vista should have been.

By the same token, the Prosecution has to convince a dozen such people, in terms they can clearly understand and have no doubt nor confusion over, that the accused is actually guilty of the charges.

P.S.  newlinechar  newlinechar This message brought to you by CENTCOM, your loving military.
I am not an Objectivist personally, and I have no problem with people criticizing Rand. I would prefer it, of course, that they do it for valid reasons. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with you that she did very often appear hostile and she could be very harsh to her critics. While such behavior is personally offensive to me, I can understand why someone might react in such a manner. She was much more a public figure than I will ever be, so I cannot claim to have shared the massive disapproval, distortions, and sometimes outright lies that she faced. I do not know if I too would become harsher if this was my context. newlinechar  newlinechar Regardless, I look at her philosophy as a thing distinct from her personality, and my comments are mostly directed towards the former. newlinechar  newlinechar Her attitude towards 'dangerous ideas' will probably not be popular among libertarians today, but it was consistent with her philosophy as a whole. She believed that it was the proper role of government to protect the country from foreigners who would do it harm. Consequently: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. She believed that containing actual physical threats, such as quarantining people who had an infectious disease that might harm Americans, was perfectly valid. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. While she believed in free speech, she thought it was well within reason for the government to prohibit entry to people who supported the idea of harming America by violent means. Which is another way of saying that she thought Americans had the right to say 'you're free to say whatever you want, but if you threaten to physically harm us, we are free to not let you into our country.' Since only government can actually prevent foreigners from entering the country, this would be a valid role of government, in her view. I am pretty sure that this would only apply to people who actually threatened harm, not to people who simply disagreed with whatever the majority of Americans think. newlinechar  newlinechar Her ideas about free speech are somewhat complex, and not easily explained in a short post. I can offer a quote and then a brief explanation of what I think it means. newlinechar  newlinechar From **The Fascist New Frontier**: newlinechar  newlinechar *Freedom of speech means freedom from interference, suppression or punitive action by the government — and nothing else. It does not mean the right to demand the financial support or the material means to express your views at the expense of other men who may not wish to support you. Freedom of speech includes the freedom not to agree, not to listen and not to support one’s own antagonists.* newlinechar  newlinechar As you can see, this a two-fold statement. She says that free speech means that you are free to say what you please without coercion, but **only** if you can do so without requiring the support of other unwilling citizens. This distinction is important in practice, because conflicting situations happen all too often. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, consider a professor at a university, who tells his students in class that all Muslims (or Jews) are raving lunatics. The university fires him, he appeals on the basis that his free speech rights have been violated. newlinechar  newlinechar In this case, Rand would say that he had no such free speech rights if he used the physical or intellectual assets of the university (the classroom, the students *in* the classroom). In other words, if you want to spout off, do it on your own time and your own money, the university is not obliged to give you a forum for it. newlinechar  newlinechar The situation gets more complex if it's a tax-payer supported university. Of course, Rand would then argue that there ought to be no government supported universities, since education was not a valid function of government in her opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar But the fundamental principle, according to her, would remain that **if** it were a private university, then the owner(s) of the university would be perfectly within their rights to fire the professor. It would be a contradiction to support the 'free speech' rights of the professor against the private property rights of a university or a business, to force them to continue employing someone they did not wish to. In such a case, she would extend it to the situation where the professor said the same thing **not** in the classroom, but at a TV interview in his own home. Again, the principle being that free speech or not, as an employer I should not be forced to hire and retain someone I don't like or want. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, this is just a brief summary. If you are interested, I would suggest that you read what she had to say about this in her own words. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Yes, she did oppose the IRS. Her view was that income taxes are slavery, and that governments should be supported by voluntary means, not by forcing citizens to pay taxes. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Yes, she did oppose the Federal Reserve. Her view was that the government should not have any role whatsoever in directing or controlling the economy. She believed firmly in the gold standard. newlinechar  newlinechar These, and many such ideas that she proposed were eventually adopted by the libertarians. I do not claim that she was the first to ever say these things, but historically, much of her philosophy (though in the form of specific injunctions, without the benefit of the actual philosophy that she thought supported them) eventually found its way into the libertarian corpus.

A growing segment of professional game developers have been making this argument for at least the last decade. newlinechar  newlinechar Fundamentally, it's a scaling problem. Not something simple like smaller teams, more games. Your math is too simplistic. There is some fixed overhead per-project, both in resources and management. In some ways, a larger team can be more affordable due to time. newlinechar  newlinechar Bottom-line, it's a multi-year strategy to shift a company like Electronic Arts or Activision from a big budget, big team production model to a small budget, small team production model.

   For the sake of argument, why would not having a gun make him a 'dipshit?' The man was the very definition of a Romantic; such concerns as safety are secondary to the Romantic's journey, afterthoughts in their minds even. newlinechar  newlinechar    People often slight Christopher McCandless with similar charges (that entering the wild with no survival experience or map was idiotic). McCandless didn't forget such basics becasue he was a dipshit. He did it as a conscientious decision to reject everything he knew in order to start anew. newlinechar  newlinechar    Calling a Romantic an idiot isn't a diservice. Trying to apply common sense to their actions is futile becasue the very tenets of Romanticism are based on the rejection of rationalism.  newlinechar  newlinechar    Then again, I didn't know the man. Maybe he was a 'dipshit.'

I loved growing up where I did. I could get a job anywhere in town, because I had a good reputation; I just had to ask. You could do anything you wanted-- I played three sports, was on scholastic bowl, academic challenge, science olympiad, and was in student government, yearbook committee, the school play, band, and so on-- not that I was motivated or particularly good at any of those things, but you didn't have to beat others out for the position.  newlinechar  newlinechar We never had principles that followed bullshit rules because that's how they were written; basically, people used common sense. I got pulled over one time, by Joe the drummer in the high school band, and he told me to get my taillight fixed without even asking for a license or registration; when my battery died on a Friday night after a football game, I had a person jumping my car a minute later, and three people also parked on the side of the road just to give a hand and shoot the shit. From second grade until my senior year of college, I had 2 of the same best friends. Of course I had whole other groups of friends that came and went, especially in college, but it's damn nice to be so close to some people. newlinechar  newlinechar There are some times when I'm embarrassed about minor things, but I think growing up in a town like that, then learning to think for yourself and getting a college education is the best thing in the world. I've been treated like an adult since I was in second grade, basically, and I feel like I fit in anywhere-- I love San Francisco, Chicago, and Cheyenne; I'm not the least intimidated by a big racist dude in flannel or offended by a flaming dude hitting on me. newlinechar  newlinechar Say what you want, there's a lot to be said for small towns. Yeah, the CD burning is weird, but 90% of my friends grew out of religion in a practical sense, and only believe it so far as it comforts them from time to time. newlinechar  newlinechar Okay that went on long. I kinda miss home :(

&gt;I used to be a truther. newlinechar  newlinechar I am a former truther as well, and can relate to the majority of your post. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry Cyince, but this next part is kind of directed at HopeForManKind. In another thread where I did not want to go off topic, he asked me a question about my views. I thought a submission was a bit much for someone in my position in this reddit, as all it would get is downmodded into oblivion. I figure at least it's somewhat on topic in this thread... newlinechar  newlinechar ... newlinechar  newlinechar A friend of mine a long time ago introduced me to some videos, and got me into the basics like Loose Change an all that. I felt like my eyes had been opened. The information was so amazing, and unbelievable, and almost numbing at first. Cause I really thought 'this might all be possible'. I believed in it for a couple years, and researched it, but was never really vocal about it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Later on, as the movement spread to places like here, and digg, and infowars/prisonplanet became popular, there was a big shift in thought for me. There came a time where the more vocal truthers got to a point where they couldn't be wrong, and it disgusted me. People predicted the invasion of Iran, governments releasing Bird Flu, and numerous Martial Law dates. Guess what? I lived through them all, because nothing happened. It made me question all of the same people who were 'so sure of everything else'. I mean if they are %100 sure Martial Law was coming, and they had proof the elections were going to be suspended, why did it never happen? If they bring the same passionate argument to me about controlled demo, why should I just accept it without questioning it? newlinechar  newlinechar I became disenchanted with the movement, realizing that I just keep seeing the same plots, the same predictions, and the same old evidence written like its new. First it was just the neo-cons being bad, now it's Obama too. It was bird flu, and now swine flu. Martial law is still imminent, and has been for quite some time. The elections were going to be suspended, all of the guns were supposed to be gone, and I should be in a FEMA camp right now. newlinechar  newlinechar As for the official story, I buy most of it. I believe 3 planes hit the towers and the pentagon. I believe the impacts, the fires, time, and gravity, were responsible for bringing them down. But can I prove the people who hijacked those planes weren't just *allowed* to carry out that mission? Nope. newlinechar  newlinechar My reasoning is, if the government told us 3 planes did what they did, and we all saw it, then that is probably what happened. They have no reason to lie about what we all *saw*. Not because I believe what they tell me, but because that's what happened. It would be far easier for a few of the powerful elite to pay people to have this done, to fund it, to plan it, to *allow* it to happen. That is reasonable, because there wouldn't have to be nearly anyone in on it. When you start talking about missiles, and controlled demo, your bringing in thousands of people to the conspiracy. They could have obtained the exact same results if those building hadn't collapsed. For all we know that was just an added bonus for either the government or terrorists, depending on how you look at it. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason I still read this subr, is because I like to read the information, and there are nuggets of truth that do force myself to reevaluate my stance, and possibly change my opinion.  newlinechar  newlinechar I read this because I am open minded, and I can't claim to be so unless I educate myself with information from the whole spectrum. newlinechar

I think the same things. newlinechar  newlinechar Its sad that a lot of people here think that asking 'what caused and made possible the conditions for the big bang?' is irrelevant and a waste of time. Then why can't I shake thinking about it? Maslow's hierarchy of needs would dictate that people not wondering about this have not made it to the top of that hierarchy at this point in their lives. Just a thought. newlinechar  newlinechar I appreciate the conclusions atheists make, but I chose to be a theist. I acknowledge all the crap I get for it, but I just can't eliminate that part of me that keeps thinking of concepts beyond our three dimensions and universe. newlinechar  newlinechar I just ask questions. newlinechar  newlinechar As for existence, I mentioned Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As much as it is criticized, I firmly believe that people that are self-actualized are the most satisfied and happy. Then there are people chasing different pursuits, finding happiness in fleeting places, wondering why they're miserable when they have everything, having trouble finding love, etc., and I've come to realize that they've forgotten to be content within themselves.

&gt;You're analogy is still broken in that most of the work involved in selling a game is making the game, not distributing it. newlinechar  newlinechar Making the game == landscaping the garden.  They're both services performed to create an end product.  Who cares about the actual distribution of the software?  You're not pirating the distribution, you're pirating the software. newlinechar  newlinechar The gardener is obviously not a perfect example as far as the contracting part goes.  However, the motive behind it still applies: you want to take the end result of someone else's hard work just because you 'decided' that you're not going to pay for it.  If you think it is acceptable, you're still a thief.  They say 'We made this: you want it?  You buy it.'  and then you say 'I want it but since I can get it for free I'm not going to pay.'  That's theft.
You should first recognize that you're looking for the solution to a nonlinear ODE, specifically: newlinechar  newlinechar     \dot{v} + D v^2 = G(t), newlinechar  newlinechar where G(t) contains the friction term and the fraction with the exponential. Nonlinear ODEs rarely have closed form solutions, so you might be better off using a numerical integration scheme, e.g. 4th-order [Runge-Kutta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge_kutta), to compute the velocity over a given timespan and then use some least squares method to approximate the velocity with a polynomial of some given degree.

Jefferson's reference to 'general welfare' has nothing to do with the current meaning of welfare.

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=tileproxy&amp;l=1 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Created as FREEWARE by Christian Buchner, it's a real-time interface between Microsoft's Flight Simulator X and the Internet. It will download photo-terrain textures from online map services by acting as a proxy server and file format converter. This tool turns your Flight Simulator into an interactive 3D map browser unlike anything you have experienced before. In FSX resolution levels of up to 30cm per pixel can now be achieved. It may also be used with Flight Simulator 2004 (FS9) though texture resolution is limited to 4.75 meters per pixel, (as pictured above...still very nice!). With the latest version (Beta 8) Dual Core (and above) PC's now experience very fast load times in FSX. For older machines, FS9 will enjoy faster load times than FSX however. Recent versions of TileProxy now also include global water masks so FS water bodies and shorelines, with the usual reflections and FS water effects, are present! newlinechar  newlinechar

That strip has a good and valid point to it - there are often cheaper ways to compromise a cipher than actually breaking it - but applying the point to this question is over-extending the point. newlinechar  newlinechar A DSA key is used to sign things, nothing else.  If you beat somebody with a wrench until they tell you their DSA key, you'll be able to fradulantly sign emails as coming from them for as long as it takes them to sign a revocation certificate for that key.  That's it.  You won't be able to get any future utility out of the key, and in fact the revocation will cast suspicion on recently signed messages, so there's practically no utility in a wrench attack against DSA.  There *is* utility in recovering the key through cryptanalysis, so making sure the key size is large enough is a valid concern. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if it were an RSA key that the person divulged, *then* the wrench-wielder could go back over records from eavesdropping and decrypt old messages, and the victim can't prevent this after the attack by revoking something, so the wrench attack has some utility.  Just as a nit-pick: you wouldn't encrypt your laptop harddrive with RSA, you'd use a symmetric algorithm like AES. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, even in the case of the RSA key, where wrench attacks work, it's entirely possible that there are bad guys with access to the ciphertext who don't know your physical location and hence can't possibly wrench attack you and will have to resort to cryptanalysis.  So having an appropriate key size still matters even then.

The main goal right now is to prevent the swine flu from mutating into a highly virulent form.  The only way to do that is through eradication.  The genes you are talking about (V-D-J regions of the immunoglobulin genes) do get passed down, but not how you'd think.  V-D-J segments are not rearranged in the germline.  Upon antigen exposure are these genes rearranged.  The germline segments allow for the whole of our antibody repertoire against a wide variety of pathogens.  The rearranged genes, however, are not passed down in the germline.  Think of it in laymen's terms.  Most everybody from older generations was exposed to chickenpox.  Maternal antibodies/passive immunity aside as they do not offer protection against influenza past around 1 year of age if the mother is experiences influenza infection prior to birth, are those rearranged genes passed down to the children?  No, which is precisely why we need to vaccinate our children against chickenpox.   newlinechar  newlinechar The only thing increased exposure to the swine flu would cause right now is an increase in the mutation rate of the virus.  Those viruses that are better able to propagate will spread through the population rapidly.  Right now, containment is absolutely crucial and although people may joke about the number of confirmed cases in comparison to other conditions such as obesity on the front page, I cannot stress enough just how devastating this flu will be if we see rapid viral propagation especially in the age of global travel in the absence of a vaccine and with the current state of the virus in that it is 'knocking down' younger, healthy individuals unlike seasonal flu that largely affects children and older individuals. newlinechar  newlinechar It will make the 1918 Spanish flu seem like Candyland.

I had to look up Christopher McCandless. While I admire the idea of running off and living off the land in Alaska. The fact that he barely prepared or learned survival skills and starved to death four months after he embarked, I'd have to say he crossed into the dipshit spectrum at some point. 
Here's my theory: The Republicans will go completely batshit crazy.
It's also a culture based upon insecurity and contrivance, of simultaneous self indulgent and egotistical, cultural collectivism.  newlinechar  newlinechar The main example of this is the use of self-humour, the 'irony' of dressing in socially defined unaesthetically accepted clothing as a means of mocking the very clothing being worn is emblematic of the inability to define oneself, it represents the desire of self-affirmation through invoking the collective's perception of what is and is not acceptable. newlinechar  newlinechar It is also an evasive culture: the adoration of obscure music as a means to avoid criticism of one's taste in music (if no one has heard it, it cannot be criticized), the invocation of irony as a means to avoid criticism of one's taste in clothes (I am clearly *not* lame as I am personifying what lameness would be, ironically). newlinechar  newlinechar Essentially, it is a culture that is defined by what it *is not* rather than what it is. It is culture that embraces nothing, but rejects qualities that everyone, hipsters and non-hipsters alike collectively reject.  newlinechar  newlinechar It is, dare I say, the anti-anti culture. Rather than, as previous anti-cultures have done, reject societal norms, the hipster culture has instead completely and profoundly embraced the collective definition of what is and is not acceptable and used it as a means of counter-defining themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar In summary, aka TLDR: newlinechar  newlinechar The hipster can be defined thusly: newlinechar  newlinechar We are not what you think we are. newlinechar  newlinechar We are what you think we are not.

Man really... 'fractal like' is not fractal.  From the comments on that page: newlinechar  newlinechar 'Great pictures! However, several of these examples are not fractals. The usual mathematical definition (a noninteger Hausdorff dimension) is not true for the seashells, pineapples, peacocks, sea urchins and crystals. Self-similarity is not true for crystals, pineapples and peacocks. In particular crystals are very non-fractal since they look extremely different globally (a polyhedron) and locally (a plane). That said, many crystal masses do seem to have a fractal structure with facets on all scales. newlinechar  newlinechar In the end, these pictures are beautiful examples of complex systems. But it is hard to find any neat definition that sums up them all - most are created through recursive application of rules, but that is not enough to guarantee complexity, fractality or beauty on its own.' newlinechar  newlinechar Complex semi-repeating patterns are not fractals.  Organisms that grow according to simple genetic rules that repeat are not fractals. newlinechar  newlinechar You can absolutely see many examples of approximate fractals in nature, but no true fractals. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a high degree of similarity in the universe simply because we exist in a closed system (the universe) which is subject to a relatively constrained set of physical laws which limit diversity. newlinechar  newlinechar But saying that the universe is functionally fractal in nature is a statement that contains almost no actual information.  All you're actually saying is that lots of things are similar, and some things in the universe arrange themselves in pattern that roughly repeats in specific scales. newlinechar  newlinechar That statement is as useful as saying all human beings are roughly the same sex, roughly the same size and roughly the same age.  It offers no useful information about human beings. newlinechar  newlinechar If your bar for 'fractal' is so low as to be meaningless, then fine, the whole universe is fractal.  I mean, humans are fractal right?  We've got 5 things sticking out of a core, and each of those things has five things coming out of them... it's totally fractal!  Except none of those five things has anything coming out of them.  And really your head only has like 3 things technically coming out, and oh, boys actually have like another thing coming out of that central core, but I guess if you count that, then girls have 2 more things... etc. etc. etc.  If you're willing to ignore everything that makes something not fit a pattern, then yeah, I guess everything fits the pattern.  Good for you.
&gt; ... or it could be the straw that broke the camel's back. newlinechar  newlinechar touche, good sir. however, this is not the straw that broke the ruby community's back. it is a reaction to the programming community in general, and from this i state it is completely unfair to strap this onto the ruby community. this is why i want this conversation to stop. it is unfairly focused on my community based on an arbitrary case study. newlinechar  newlinechar if you were to pose this question to the programming community in general you would find, i posit, a very similar distribution of conflicting viewpoints. from this i say that this is not a ruby community problem, and to make us a scapegoat (which we are becoming, in my view) is preposterous, unfair, and unhelpful.  newlinechar  newlinechar i will qualify by saying that i mean 'scapegoat' in the judaic sense of arbitrarily binding your sins to a healthy goat and then sending it off into the desert to die a horrible death in the hopes that you will never have to deal with the problems that put that goat out there in the first place.  newlinechar  newlinechar but, of course, you will. no sins walk into the desert with that goat. only some person's conscience. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar all of this, though, is somewhat disingenuous. we both know that there are a precious few programming communities that would host something simultaneously as vast and localized as goruku to begin with. if you open enough free speech slots to enough people you are eventually going to find one that pisses a bunch of individuals off in about the worst way possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar cheers. we found it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Clearly you do give a shit, because this discussion has long since branched off into a discussion of the difficulties women face in this field newlinechar  newlinechar i do give a shit, and i agree with what you say here, but i have a very strong sentiment that this entire conversation has been extremely industry dominant and, at the same time, language-community heavy in the worst way possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar if we want to have an industry conversation, let's do that. but this talk is not even a drop in that bucket. newlinechar  newlinechar like i said, if you want to have a discussion about women in software, i don't care. that is not a conversation i am particularly interested in, but one i recognize happens for a good reason. but the space that this discussion is occupying currently is 100% inappropriate. newlinechar  newlinechar at the same time, it is very high minded of the ruby community to have this conversation so publicly and so awkwardly. no matter which side of the argument people have fallen on, if they have something to say they have said it. i think that this is to our credit as a community rather than to our detriment. newlinechar  newlinechar i stand by the idea that this, as regards the ruby community specifically, is the aftermath of an entirely isolated incident set against a backdrop of inequality. it should be treated as such and not as some affront put forward from the ruby community against sensibilities toward interpersonal respect. at the same time, we should use this situation to recognize that there are no universal metrics for what is a proper sensibility toward interpersonal respect.  newlinechar  newlinechar indeed, if it were simply a matter of equality the same jokes that are made between men and women respectively would be made by both together. if this conversation has shown anything definitively, it has been that that is absolutely not the case. newlinechar  newlinechar i also maintain that such a sentiment of separation is kind of sexist to begin with. that is my personal opinion and not something that i believe factors into this discussion directly.. but in the interest of full disclosure i felt like i should offer my disposition.

Dick Chney had a death squad: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a1PtiiNqtg newlinechar  newlinechar 
I think the logical argument is there, just without detail. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's get started. Sexually using children is physically and mentally traumatizing to them. The job of a parent is to prevent trauma and death of children. So, would it not be justified to keep any individual away who might potentially traumatize a child, even with violence? newlinechar  newlinechar Now, consider that p3do has a history of advocating sexual use of children. That would make it seem as if he might personally do such a thing. Well, that alone seems to be enough reason to do whatever it takes to keep him, and people like him, away from any children I might have, in order to prevent trauma. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, I used the phrase 'break your fucking nose', but that's because it makes me sound angry, which is a nice touch for a comment aimed at someone who is ethically repulsive. It's gets the point across that a parent doesn't give a shit about deluded opinions when it comes to the well being of their offspring. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, did I really have to go into detail on something that should be fairly... Instinctual to understand?
I'll argue that they are mostly pissed off at the governments all too friendly embrace with a lucky few in the financial industry. newlinechar  newlinechar I doubt anyone is calling for a return to the Gilded Age or abandoning the Food and Drug Safety Act...

Most of them were not partisan hacks, regardless of what Fox wants you to believe. newlinechar  newlinechar But I guess everyone can just freak out and argue about socialism versus capitalism instead of focusing on enacting intelligent banking regulation for the 21st century.

I came to post the same thing but was saddened that you were modded down to 0, so I modded you up. newlinechar  newlinechar As long as we're on the subject, my little daughter learned how to snort spontaneously.

I'd expect quite the opposite: Mario would be a disgusting sweat, mud, and blood-covered pig by the time he burst into the Princess' chamber, panting heavily, singed in several places, and likely concussed. The princess would be faring no better, likely having torn apart her own dress to make a noose out of, or just having soiled herself in her clothes several times out of an aristocratic sense of shame at being uncovered. That they managed to be attracted enough to one another to kiss in that condition is remarkable... however, seeing as they were the only two *human beings* within a thousand-mile radius of one another, I can see the attraction. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if we're talking about Zelda, you might have a point here. I imagine that as soon as Link had cleared the final chamber, he took a quick trip to the loo (and quite a loo it would be—it's Zelda's castle, after all) to freshen up before actually waking Zelda.
&gt;does that mean that they should be perpetually entitled to a portion of their husband's income in return? newlinechar  newlinechar In the case of divorce? Or even while they are married? In the former, it's called alimony and it is granted on a case-by-case basis with employment history being an important factor in the granting of it. If you're talking about the latter, the wife generally already receives that in the form of food, housing, medical care, entertainment, goods, etc.
More accurately, it's saying that a gender *discrimination* based pay gap doesn't exist. That the gap (which the article acknowledges as actually existing) is in fact caused by other factors.
You know shockingly little about DC Continuity.  newlinechar  newlinechar In fact Power Girl was one of the *only* characters from Earth-2 to survive the Crisis on Infinite Earths completely intact. You get two large, pillowy, heaving guesses as to why.  newlinechar  newlinechar It was a huge plot point during 'Infinite Crisis,' 2006's ill-advised attempt to bring back multiple earths (DC is a total case of inmates running the asylum these days, with the top writers/editors doing everything they can to bring back the characters/milieu of their youth in spite of decades of hard-earned universal development) that Power Girl was one of the only DC characters with no real memory of her past and no idea who she really was.  newlinechar  newlinechar She got her memory and realized she was one of a handful of people to escape Earth-2 before it was destroyed, and had to go through some justified angst in coming to grips with the fact that everyone she ever knew up until a certain point is dead and gone.  newlinechar  newlinechar Super Woman came back along with all the other members of the Crime Syndicate back around 2000 when Grant Morrison did a JLA miniseries about them. It's now Earth-3 I believe. newlinechar  newlinechar Supergirl did die during Crisis on Infinite Earths but she's had at least 3 replacements in the interim followed by the latest iteration who is basically the 'classic' Supergirl (basic powers, appearance, backstory) nobody but the inmates running the asylum asked for except she's not (further backstory, characterization, costume design).  newlinechar  newlinechar Dude, trying to pimp yourself as literate in comic book canon is one infinitesimal step above claiming to know Star Wars canon.  newlinechar  newlinechar There are people who know way more than you could ever hope to and they're not far away from a keyboard, and practically live to put their otherwise completely useless skill to use in dick-slapping the unknowledgeable.  newlinechar  newlinechar We are the Comic Book Guys of the world.  newlinechar  newlinechar Go ahead and make fun of us for being fat (not me) or virgins (also not me, sorry) or for caring too much about something almost completely useless in the real world (you've got me there), but don't you ever try to fuck with us on continuity. You will get hurt.    newlinechar  newlinechar

Fork?  Isn't that what open source is all about?
I did some more research. You have to provide either the source or a written offer of the source along with any GPL binary. If a smaller distro *non-commerically* passes along binaries from a larger one, they can just pass along the original distro's offer of source code, according to [this document](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesWrittenOfferValid). So, it appears that you are correct in the case of non-commercial distribution, at least according to my interpretation of what the FSF says. newlinechar  newlinechar Standardising packaging is still a goddamn stupid idea, though. What happens with dependencies if two different distros have different libraries installed, for example? It makes no sense.
Oh wow that's pretty interesting.  Thanks for clearing it up.  Some of my friends may not be too happy when they hear this.
Known physical models are pretty good at excluding that kind of becoming-your-own-grandfather effect, so while this kind of result could strictly speaking be the work of some totally unknown physical principle, it still seems like a bit of a stretch. newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, if the premise is that the higgs boson somehow conspires to prevent itself from being observable, you'd run into the problem that there are sources of high energy collisions other than man-made accelerators.  Like say... cosmic rays, which would mean that in order for the theory the higgs would also have to prevent the existence of cosmic rays with sufficient energy to produce it, otherwise it would be statistically possible (although hideously inefficient) to search for it with a space based detector.   newlinechar  newlinechar The only way i see of getting around *that* is to say that the detector just wouldn't work, but since the higgs is predicted to be relatively high energy, and the detectors at particle accelerators incorporate calorimetry to sum up the energy of all the particles generated in the collisions, one would have to assume that it would be impossible to construct a calorimeter with a sensitivity great enough to detect the absence of the (relatively large) higgs, which can't be the case, or they'd never have bothered trying to build the thing in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, if somewhat convoluted argument doesn't do it for you, consider Occam's Razor.  Our options are: newlinechar  newlinechar 1.) An incredibly complex machine the with innumerable parts has some glitches at first or  newlinechar  newlinechar 2.) The universe conspires by way of time-traveling fundamental particles to prevent any machine capable of detecting said time-traveling particles from ever being completed. newlinechar  newlinechar Which sounds more likely to be true?

&gt; If it's happening with unmitigated angst, anger and rudeness, there's a potential troll. newlinechar  newlinechar That's the only thing that I'd consider a person trolling with. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If it's happening from the same user every time, there's a potential troll. newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of people bring up the same or similar points in discussion with different people. Scrolling through almost anyone's comments you're bound to find multiple of the same or similar arguments in different places. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If it's happening when the logic they're using can be consistently countered, pointed out as incorrect and seen as packaged lies, there's a potential troll. newlinechar  newlinechar Problem is the logic used by most people can be consistently countered, that's why we have discussions.

Modern use of the word Queer means not-heteronormative. Therefore-- intersexuals are queer, BDSM practitioners are queer, gays are queer, straights who like pegging are queer. Queer isn't a 'label' in the way that 'straight' is a label, but a resistance from traditional labels. Queer is a catch-all term and a way of saying that sexuality is so complicated that it's useless to continue to categorize it by gender and in heteronormative terms, therefore we use Queer.

One problem is a changing of the English word believe/belief as well as the usage of the word faith. The root for the word believe is actually the word love. When you get back to texts before the 14th century you're actually talking about a completely different concept. newlinechar  newlinechar From etymonline.com: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;c.1175, replaced O.E. geleafa, from W.Gmc. *ga-laubon (cf. O.S. gilobo, M.Du. gelove, O.H.G. giloubo, Ger. glaube), from *galaub- 'dear, esteemed.' The prefix was altered on analogy of the verb. The distinction of the final consonant from that of believe developed 15c. Belief used to mean 'trust in God,' while faith meant 'loyalty to a person based on promise or duty' (a sense preserved in keep one's faith, in good (or bad) faith and in common usage of faithful, faithless, which contain no notion of divinity). But faith, as cognate of L. fides, took on the religious sense beginning in 14c. translations, and belief had by 16c. become limited to 'mental acceptance of something as true,' from the religious use in the sense of 'things held to be true as a matter of religious doctrine' (c.1225). newlinechar  newlinechar and: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;O.E. belyfan, earlier geleafa (Mercian), gelefa (Northumbrian), gelyfan (W.Saxon) 'believe,' from P.Gmc. *ga-laubjan 'hold dear, love,' from PIE base *leubh- 'to like, desire' (see love). Spelling beleeve is common till 17c.; then altered perhaps by influence of relieve. As a synonym for 'Christian,' believer is attested from 1549. To believe on instead of in was more common in 16c. but now is a peculiarity of theology; believe of also sometimes was used in 17c.
OK - I'm going to spit this out and see if it makes any sense: newlinechar  newlinechar I think of our bodies as energetically similar to a grounded battery. The 'ground' is at the base of our spine, and energy travels from there up the torso. The ground contains essentially infinite potential energy, so that it can potentially absorb all of our negative energy, and it provides positive energy if we are lacking. If the connection with the ground is constrained, all of the energy stagnates in the higher parts of the torso, and we become manic or dissociate from reality.  newlinechar  newlinechar I see the body as having three main centers (sort of like chakras). One at the root, one at the heart, and one in our head. I feel like these centers are not fixed, and there may be other minor transient energy centers as well. I am very interested in the experience of emotion and consciousness as it relates to this energy framework.  newlinechar  newlinechar Some emotions are very clear to me in terms of the associated sensations:  newlinechar  newlinechar - Fear is a tightening of the abdomen (root), which pushes all the energy up to the top (heart and head). It's hard for me to see how this causes us to lose bowel control when startled, but I think it's because there is no energy below to retain it. newlinechar  newlinechar - Anger is very similar to fear, but there seems to be some difference in whether energy is directed more outward or inward. Still not at all clear on this distinction. In chinese medicine, anger is considered to be an excess of 'pushing', or forcing energy outwards. newlinechar  newlinechar - Depression and sadness also seem to be closely correlated with anger. There is some sense of emptiness or deficiency in the heart in both cases - an absence of the 'good' feeling. With depression, the negative sensations are directed inwards, but with anger they are pushed outwards. There seems to be more to it than that also, because depression usually coincides with an overall lack of energy or impetus. newlinechar  newlinechar - I also see these energy centers sort of like gates. The positive emotional states are associated with the gates being open, allowing free flow of energy. The optimal state is to have unrestricted flow of energy in the body, with a solid connection to the ground. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm pretty wiped out so that's all I can think of for now. It probably seems like a bit of a rant, but I really spend a lot of time thinking about this stuff, and it's very rare to encounter someone who can discuss it openly without bringing a whole lot of baggage to the exchange. Thanks for your consideration.

Excellent question!  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That one would have to be decided on an individual basis. Let me present a few different scenarios and I'll give my opinion on each: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1.  Let's say the guy walks in the door of his house and sees this guy raping his wife. He goes bananas on the guy and ends up killing him in the process.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 2.   Same situation but the rapist sees the guy and flees. The husband runs after him and chases relentlessly, catches him and then kills him. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 3.   Same situation but the husband doesn't catch the guy. He later finds out who he is and hunts him down and kills him. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The first one I think there would be grounds for aquittal because the husband could claim he feared for his or his wife's life. (Self-defense) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The second one would be determined more on how much the prosecution could prove the husband chased the guy. With a good lawyer he could get off. Personally I think that if he is charged, it should be no worse than 2nd degree murder or manslaughter. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The third case is much different. This murder would definately be premeditated. This is murder-one all the way. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think your question brings up a very valid point to the whole arguement this reddit is discussing. It proves there are different circumstances of murder. The arguement of saying a crime is a crime regardless of the motive or intent does not hold up. Your question brings some important insight to this discussion that I don't think most people considered. Please let me know what your thoughts on this are. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar   Thank You, newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar backpackwayne

You're completely missing the point.  Apparently the word 'porn' lights up whole sections of your brain that make it impossible for you to focus on anything else. newlinechar  newlinechar The issue here is not whether porn is degrading, or whether this was porn, or what the definition of porn is.  The word 'pr0n' happened to be used in the title of the presentation, but try to get past that and look at the content of the pictures, and think about their implications. newlinechar  newlinechar Some of the pictures in this presentation could have been of fully-clothed people in similar situations, and they would still have been problematic.  For example, one of the pictures shows a bunch of women fawning over a single man.  There were no pictures that showed anything like the reverse of that.   newlinechar  newlinechar The visual message of the entire presentation was essentially that men are powerful and strong, and that women are second-class objects whose purpose is the gratification of men - of their egos and sexual urges. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said, perhaps you don't see a problem with that.

What do you mean here?

It's an interesting theory, but the author consistently over-reaches and makes basic errors in his reasoning process, until ultimately the best he can offer is: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it would not surprise me whatsoever that Dick Cheney deployed one of these JSOC teams to bring about his death. newlinechar  newlinechar Nobody with an ounce of rational reasoning ability *concludes* anything based on 'well, it *might* have happened'. newlinechar  newlinechar You keep an open mind, or 'suspect' things.  Concluding on the basis of a supposition is irrational, stupid and unwarranted. newlinechar  newlinechar For example: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; an FBI spokesman, Paul McCabe, would announce that night that there were “no signs of terrorist involvement”... Since the cause of the crash was not yet known, how could the FBI have possibly known? newlinechar  newlinechar 'No signs of' does not mean 'did not happen'.  It means 'We have no *evidence or reason to believe* this happened'.  Basic semantics fail. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If we assume that these are independent events that might happen, say, one time in a hundred... then for one pilot to neglect all three would be equal to... one time in a million. newlinechar  newlinechar Right.  but if these *weren't* independent events, it's much more probable.  If we *assume* that there's no connection between 'being on a road' and 'being killed in a car crash', then pretty much every road accident ever was incredibly unlikely, too. newlinechar  newlinechar OTOH, if we assume there *might* have been a connection between the plane deviating from its planned route and the same plane crashing soon after, suddenly it's not necessarily quite such an improbable, million-to-one event. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; if you considered the possible use of a... directed-energy device, then the latter would confer a high probability upon the evidence, including... reports I had confirmed that garage doors in the vicinity had opened spontaneously that morning. newlinechar  newlinechar So they were aiming at a light plane in the sky, and somehow managed to hit various garage-door openers on the ground?

The concept of the 'alpha' male has changed over the years.

We are materialists, it is to the material advantage of most people in the human race to fight for socialism. Is there really a superior moral basis here or are we just fighting for material and historical neccessity? Can we claim moral superiority when we seek to destroy the bourgoisie just as they stamp on the working class? Aren't we really just reversing the class roles, so the bourgoisie are oppressed, which is of course to our advantage but is it really morally superior as we would still be oppressing another class?

That's funny, because I actually am quite up on comparative politics (i.e. not restricted to the U.S.), and liberal is used in such a wide variety of ways as to lose any meaning.  Perhaps if I only watched CNN and Fox I would use that definition of liberal, but seeing as I tend to want to actually know something about the issues I'm discussing, I stick with more academic sources, which have no such standard for liberal that says they all like government health care, action on climate change, higher taxes on the rich, improved access to welfare, and so on. newlinechar  newlinechar Part of the issue is that mgibbons seemed to imply that Republicans are split, and therefore he doesn't like being called a Republican.  I'm not saying that liberal doesn't have a general usage in the U.S., I'm saying that applying it without allowing for nuance (like mgibbons did), is just as foolish as painting Republicans or conservatives in broad strokes.

&gt; A software licence agreement is not law. They are a type of disclaimer and all disclaimers are open to challenge. newlinechar  newlinechar A software licensing agreement is a contract that you agree to in order to run the software.  My ex was a lawyer for 20+ years and also sat on the bench.  Her specialty was contract law.  Courts are very reluctant to interfere with contracts unless they violate contract law.  For example, all EULAs limit liability of the vendor.  Unless the EULA exceeds liability limitation in your jursidiction, you're pretty much SOL. newlinechar  newlinechar You can challenge them if you like... but you're not likely to win. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it is not at all difficult if you are Wal Mart, Exxon Mobil, Toyota, or other businesses of that size. It's very easy. newlinechar  newlinechar How is this even relevant to the discussion?  The fact that a few companies have deep enough pockets to take these companies to court doesn't do any good for those of us who aren't these big companies.  This is nothing but a red herring. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If I'm the CIO or IT Director of one of those big companies - and the software I chose failed and cost the company a billion dollars - someone is going to ask me where I got that software and why I chose it.

He has accused me of being everything from a pedophile to being an active participant in mass murder. newlinechar  newlinechar Please remember that the so-called 'Bury Brigade' are not the ones demonstrating this behavior. This is purely on Nathan. I believe that if anyone has demonstrated troll-like, disruptive behavior, it's him. To have him come into a thread like this and accuse others, including you, of being trolls is the epitome of hypocrisy. newlinechar  newlinechar Nathan's problem isn't that he's bothered by all of this, he thrives on negative attention. His problem is that he believes that there should be absolutely no discussion at all on the subject other than everyone marching in lock-step and agreeing with everything he says. He desperately wants to be the internet version of Alex Jones and to accomplish that goal he has adopted many of Jones' tactics. Character assassination, bullying, lying, shouting down his opponents and claiming that every argument except his is simply a strawman argument. He's intellectually dishonest and completely lacking in moral character. newlinechar  newlinechar I would love to get back to what I was doing but I am under attack constantly by one of the biggest trolls to ever hit Reddit. The way he has performed on this thread should clearly demonstrate that he will even attack those that agree with him if he feels that their agreement lacks enough enthusiasm.

I simply wanted to know if you were capable of actually empathizing with victims of pedophiles, who more often than not grow up with serious mental and emotional issues. newlinechar  newlinechar And I'll stand by the usage of 'violated' in the context of sexual activity between an adult and a child, because a violation of a child's rights is what it is.
Home loan interest (mortgages or equity lines) are deductible up to a total of $100,000, or the whole amount if used to purchase the house or to add value to the house (such as remodeling or an addition). newlinechar  newlinechar So, if you buy a house for $200k, it increases in value to $300k, and you do a cashout refinance for $240k, only the interest on the amount of the original mortgage is deductible.  It doesn't matter if it is a mortgage or equity line that you refinance into. newlinechar  newlinechar In addition, just a year ago you could get a HELOC that charged an interest rate of just Prime-1.01% which right now would be 2.24%.  Still today you can get a HELOC at Prime (3.25%) which is much less than the best mortgage you can get.

I don't know if this is true for pedophilia, though. Pedophilia is more than just a harmless desire. There is a victim, no doubt, when pedophiles act on their desires. Just like men who get off on rape. We don't say that they adjust their behavior because it is illegal to rape someone in this particular country. We think it is a defect in their brain or a result of environment as a child that causes that desire, and either it gets fixed or the rapist gets punished. In my opinion, pedophilia is not different.

The best way to work in music is keys, which can VERY roughly be explained as notes that have certain relative relationships with each other according to a few things, such as the overtone series and the way the human brain just seems to be wired to hear sound. newlinechar Someone with truly perfect pitch will hear these sounds absolutely, rather than relatively, and that will damage their understanding of music.  It's not certain to, by any means, but at the very least perfect pitch does nothing to help you, because ability to distinguish *relative* pitches is what is important in music (and what someone who is Tone Deaf, as an example, can't do properly). newlinechar  newlinechar This type of perfect pitch is a different thing.  Rather than just the ability to absolutely call notes, it's more an ability to call a certain specific note.  Consider it an ability to hum a tuneing point.  What's bad here is that there is no universally standard turning point.  Western music does use a certain kind of even temperment tuned around A 440Hz that is fairly standard, but even within the western world you might use A 444Hz or 'whatever the hell our band's guitarist happens to be on right now.'  Without perfect pitch, it won't make a lick of difference where you're tuned, but with it someone will be bothered over something that is imperceptible to almost everyone in the entire world. newlinechar  newlinechar Most of the issue lies in the first point though, the mentality of the thing.  Absolute perfect pitch is not going about music the same was the human brain interprets it when it hears, and will produce something that is slightly unsettling, at best.
Oh. You're talking about car insurance. I'm talking about health insurance. My sister is a teacher in the critical range, and even with the school insurance, her rates are outrageous.

Is there an 'age group' that you find more sexually attractive than other ages? Also, do you have a preference for boys or girls, or is it more the age than the gender that you find attractive?  newlinechar  newlinechar edit: I see you answer this further on.

No that death rate is for otherwise healthy individuals who get measles and get medical care. So if there is a big measles outbreak here in the US, about one in 1000 is going to die and a lot more will have permanent brain damage.
o.0
I wasn't feeling judgmental at all, and was of the same frame of mind as you about Paedo until he tried to justify the fact that he is nurturing these thoughts and actually acting on them by putting himself in a position to be around children, actually speaking to their parents, etc. That is allowing the thoughts to nurture, and his justification may be elastic enough to encompass actual sexual contact with a child later, when his desires are being fed this way. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no justification for sexual relationships with children. It is intrinsically wrong, it is detrimental for the children, and there is no such thing as a consensual sexual relationship between an adult and a child. In our country, child has been defined as anyone under the age of 18, to be safe, but we all know that there is a gray area between I'd say, 16-18. Prepubescent children, like the ones Paedo is attracted to, are unarguably off limits to sexual contact with adults, and should stay that way.

&gt; women who assertively ask for a raise are seen as behaving inappropriately in a way men aren't. newlinechar  newlinechar I think this really depends on the industry. I have a close family friend who is regularly rated as one of the top 100 female attorneys in the country. She is almost 60, so started in this field when being a woman was a less common attribute. She says that acting like a 'bitch' is the key to her success. In the same way a man has to act like an 'asshole' to achieve the same success. In these types of fields, both sexes are viewed the same, not inappropriate, just combative. A feature which is an asset in many professions. The biggest difference is that women generally have a bigger problem being considered a bitch than a man does being considered an asshole.

I accept the possibility that our sexual orientation isn't 'fixed' at birth--however much we might feel or wish that to be the case. And if that's true then our desires, wanted or unwanted, are not a matter for blame. There are so many unknowns when it comes to sexuality that I concede there's no point claiming to have objective facts about the issue; but I think one aspect that's easier to agree on is where power lies in a child-adult relationship.  Children are by definition vulnerable: a child is dependent on adults to stay alive. That puts any adult in a position of great power vis-a-vis any child. So even if a child were to have sexual desire for an adult, as you claim, the relationship would be unacceptably distorted and it would be the adult's duty not to engage in such a relationship. This isn't about the law; it's about not doing to others what we wouldn't want done to ourselves. For that reason society is right in condemning the practice of pedophilia--despite all the hysterical crap that accompanies the condemnation.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar

&gt;Oracle has aquired many companies and none of their products have been killed. newlinechar  newlinechar Go pick me up a copy of [HotSIP](http://www.oracle.com/hotsip/index.html) then, will you? How about [ProfitLogic](http://www.oracle.com/profitlogic/index.html)?  newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously - when a major corporation acquires another company, how often do you think they leave it completely undisturbed to continue business as usual?  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Mysql is a profitable product and would benefit the bottom line of oracle. newlinechar  newlinechar Cite on 'profitable'? Also, the bottom line of Oracle is slightly larger and subject to different concerns.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If oracle destroyed a profitable product the shareholders would sue. newlinechar  newlinechar If Oracle took a competitive product out of the market and found a way to migrate its users to Oracle technologies, the shareholders wouldn't have a leg to stand on. I'm not saying this is their plan, just that 'the shareholders would sue' isn't as much of a given as you may think.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;We can look at their past history and judge for ourselves. So far they have bought two open sourced database products. They kept both of them. newlinechar  newlinechar Look up 'cherry picking.' Oracle's [list of acquisitions](http://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisition.html) is much larger, and fairly colorful. I've known customers of products that were acquired by Oracle - when the acquisition happened, they very much took a 'wait and see' attitude because there's no telling what Oracle will do with the new company.  newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously, I'm not trying to spread FUD - I'm not saying 'Oracle will pull MySQL apart' - it's entirely possible Oracle will sit the team in a corner to do their thing and build goodwill in the MySQL community. That does make sense as a business move. There are other strategies that make sense as well, like selling MySQL to IBM or Google.  newlinechar  newlinechar My *only comment* was that this is an inflection point in MySQL's path, and should have been noted in the article. *The author agrees with me, because he added it.*  newlinechar  newlinechar To sit there and say 'this doesn't mean anything; nothing bad can possibly come of this. Business as usual, move along' is seriously delusional.

Testing doesn't 'exist primarily to catch bugs.'  A proper test suite verifies that your software meets the requirements.  'I said it would do this, here is the proof that it does.'  This will find bugs, but it will also find holes in the software.  If you missed a minute feature that Widget X needs to do Y, it might not show up as a 'bug' if you're just testing for breakage. newlinechar  newlinechar Having a test setup that is only geared to find bugs is not going to fly in a decently regulated environment.  Sure, you want your tests to be more down-and-dirty in the really complex parts, but demonstrating basic functionality is (or at least should be) part of any decent test. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, it's a royal pain in the ass to write the test cases, write the test procedures, and perform all the tests (if you're unlucky enough to be involved in every step), but it's something that should be done.

I'm Deuteranoptic myself.  So I absolutely don't see the same colors others do.

So even though your actual visual perception of the color may differ from others (and that's purely subjective, so nearly impossible to test), you know this color as 'green' (or 'SuD', if you happen to be Klingon). But I might look at that same green and call it pink because, to me, it more closely resembles a light red.

That could be.

I will explain both events with some more detail. I wish I was making this up or embellishing but I am not. I make sure to always wear my seatbelt not out of fear of a ticket but for my own safety. I have had friends that have been hurt badly in accidents because they weren't wearing their seatbelts.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1. It was 2am I was driving home from work after putting in an 18 hour day. I cross the Betsy Ross Bridge connecting NE Philadelphia to Maple Shade, NJ. I am going the speed limit because I know they are out hot and heavy, I know where the cops were etc...A guy in a mini-van passes me, my estimate is going around 60-65 the speed limit is 45. My radar detector goes off I know he painted the guy. The Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) officer pulls out and follows him. The driver of the mini-van realizes what just happens and slows down to 35-40 the DRPA officer is right behind him. I continue to follow the both of them. Bear in mind I am now on a two lane highway, going 38 (the speed limit is 50). So I figure I have no business with the pending stop. I put on my turn signal and start to pass both of them as soon as I do the cop gets behind me and pulled me over. I give him my paper work; he has the obligatory questions, were you drinking, where are you coming from, where are you going etc...I wasn't drinking (I am a teetotaler). So I had nothing to worry about, mind you I am about 3-4 miles away from the bridge now. Then he tells me he pulled me over because my back tires are bald, which they were not. So I told him now way, I just put them on two weeks ago they are not. We go back and forth about the exhaust and the tires for a little bit. Then he goes back to his car comes back and says I am giving you a seatbelt ticket you can fight it but good luck. Next time you won't pass a cop will you and walks off.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 2. I am going over the Betsy Ross again (this was the last time I took the bridge into Philly) I pull up to the toll booth pay my fare and I see two cops sitting over by the DRPA building as soon as I go through the toll booth they both pull out one gets right behind me. I get all of my paper work ready because I know what is about to happen, I also called work to let them know I am going to be late I am about to be pulled over. I am coming down the bridge and the cop flips on his lights. He comes up and asks me the questions, where are you going, where are you coming from etc. Then tells me he pulled me over because my exhaust is too loud. At the time I had a silencer on it so I explain to him that the exhaust is CARB legal and therefore is legal in NJ. NJ and CARB have the same for the most part. So I give him my paper work and he then tells me that the car is too low, which I point at the NJ inspection sticker and tell him well NJMVS didn't seem to think so. He goes back to his car and comes back and is like well I am going to give you Dad a break since the insurance is in his name and just give you a seatbelt ticket. I found that to be highly insulting, I pay for my own insurance my own car etc, since I was 17, but I wasn't going to argue I just wanted to get to work. I run my thumb underneath of the belt and say really I'm not wearing my seatbelt...But he could have really have ruined my day by having my car towed.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I hope that is enough detail.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Now in defense of cops they have pulled me over several times when I was in the wrong.

I'll add you to the waiting list for my autobiography then, if you need my life story to avoid making assumptions well outside the range of a post. I'm sorry to remind you that traditional gender roles are not a synonym for women slaving at home while men frolic freely in the workplace, and that a second income doesn't necessarily mean that is a secondary career. You added the concepts of neglected and overworked wives and absent husbands to what started as a financial contempation. When I didn't include all the details of my life, you assumed that what was left out was the truly pertinant information right from the start.  As you've said, go back and read my first post. newlinechar  newlinechar I am sorry if judgmental and overbearing outsiders 'insisting' on how you raise your kids has been your experience with US culture. It sounds as though your own experiences have made you hostile toward those of us lucky enough to have the choices to worry over. When I consider my future choices, I do worry quite a bit that I will be able to finance them.  But I am realistic enough to know that while all these options are available, taking some of them closes off the others. Staying home reduces my income.  Maintaining my income reduces my time with my children. Trying to do everything reduces the ultimate satisfaction from each, and finding the right balance isn't simple.  You are never going to be able to give 110% at work while giving 110% at home.  Supermom/Superdad is a myth that is strangling our generation. newlinechar  newlinechar My own experience, also in the US, has been much different than what you describe.  In the past year, several of my friends and coworkers have had children.  In one case the couple decided as soon as she became pregnant that she would not work anymore. Her salary was much lower than his and they can afford their lifestyle on his paycheck.  Another couple just had their third child and neither salary alone is sufficient for their household expenses. She's been promoted three times since going back but frequently discusses how much she's missing with her kids. Her husband has a shorter workday, but daycare is the primary caregiver. The third couple, who both work in my field, cultivated a freelance business prior to deciding to have children.  Now he stays home and works freelance and she has a partial work-from-home week at an outside job. But they're both in their late 30s and have found actually having those children to be a challenge. newlinechar  newlinechar But in all of these cases the thing that ultimately made the decision was 'Can we afford this?', with some 'Can we wait until we CAN afford this to do it?' thrown in. 
I am not a 'hard' atheist, one that rejects the possibility of gods at every avenue.  I am an atheist that acknowledges there are things we do not know and *cannot* know given our present limitations.  Should we find a way to expand our knowledge in a way that satisfies rigorous scientific examination, then I will be content to accept those findings. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I have no problem with religion as a school of philosophy.  That's how I view it in the first place.  My problem with religion and belief in gods is that it is somehow held separate from all other schools of philosophy.  It is deemed sacred, inviolate.  In short:  people deem their beliefs should always be free from criticism.  To criticize someone's beliefs is to attack them most cruelly. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There is no concept, no school of thought that I think should be immune to criticism.  I don't care if that school is scientific, philosophical, political, personal or religious.  If you're going to put it out on a public forum, you immediately subject it to public scrutiny and, where appropriate, criticism.  Of course, by 'criticism' I don't mean *ad hominem* attacks just for the sake of attacking.  I mean criticism where we examine an idea for flaws and point them out. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are flaws in every scientific theory.  If there weren't, we couldn't update them with new information.  The way the scientific process is designed, the only way to update a theory is to examine existing theories for flaws, identify them and experiment to figure out how they can be corrected. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There are flaws in every school of philosophy.  If there weren't, there would be no reason to debate among them.  Logic systems are being challenged and updated all the time, but this doesn't bring philosophy to an end, it just strengthens them. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Politics, economics, art, literature, theater and all other aspects of our lives are subject to scrutiny, criticism and update.  Religion is the one aspect that engenders outrage when we question it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So yes, I'm all for updating our knowledge.  I also strongly advocate not allowing *anything* to be free from scrutiny, particularly not one that presumes to dictate thought and behavior to us.  If we have no way of verifying the existence of gods, then the worship of such questionable deities must also be suspect.  I do not advocate banning the practice, but I strongly believe that the more educated people are, the less need they have for the comfort and ritual of religion.

&gt; Come on, if you want to have the benefit of a high-quality justice system, you need to pull your weight. newlinechar  newlinechar In total agreement with you here. We the people that expect a high-quality justice system need to pull our weight. For starters, we need to start paying jurors fair wages. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Also: I'm sorry but one (MAAAAAAYBE two) days off work is not going to bankrupt you, even if you're poor. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, unless you get fired over it.

Good questions. Japan and Europe face similar if not worse unfunded liabilities. I'm pretty sure you won't get an answer to those questions because if you looked into it, every single country making retirement promises is going to be hosed financially.
&gt; Seriously though - what's so terrible about SQL newlinechar  newlinechar It would take a while to go through all of SQL's deficiencies, but I'll start by listing a few. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) SQL has an incredibly verbose syntax. Contrast this: newlinechar  newlinechar     SELECT * FROM students newlinechar     INNER JOIN subjects ON subjects.student_id = students.student_id newlinechar     WHERE subject_name = 'History' newlinechar  newlinechar To this: newlinechar  newlinechar     students * subjects : subject_name = 'History' newlinechar  newlinechar Which is an ISBL-inspired syntax where '*' is a natural join and ':' is selection. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) SQL syntax is massively redundant, with keywords that have no purpose other than to make the language read more like English. For example: newlinechar  newlinechar     INSERT INTO students VALUES ('John Smith') newlinechar  newlinechar Two out of the three keywords are essentially useless. It could be written: newlinechar  newlinechar     students &lt;&lt; ('John Smith') newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Hard to create temporary views. In most programming languages, you can break an algorithm up by assigning values to intermediate variables. In SQL, this is extremely difficult and inefficient: newlinechar  newlinechar     CREATE VIEW history_students AS newlinechar     SELECT * FROM students newlinechar     INNER JOIN subjects ON subjects.student_id = students.student_id newlinechar     WHERE subject_name = 'History' newlinechar  newlinechar     SELECT student_name FROM history_students newlinechar  newlinechar     DROP VIEW history_students newlinechar  newlinechar Contract that to: newlinechar  newlinechar     history_students = students * subjects : subject_name = 'History' newlinechar     history_students % student_name newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; and if it's so terrible then why haven't we developed a different, better language in the 35+ years since it was first introduced? newlinechar  newlinechar People have developed better languages; they are just not supported by the majority of relational databases.

This ^ newlinechar  newlinechar And people only believe such a poorly-argued, unsupported and speculative hypothesis (I won't even dignify it with the name 'theory') because it flatters their preconceptions. newlinechar  newlinechar If I offered an equally-poorly-supported 'theory' that actually Wellstone was killed by communists, or satanists or gays it would have rightly got laughed out of reddit, because those prejudices aren't trendy any more. newlinechar  newlinechar But blame 'the government' or (if you're a right-winger) 'terrorists' and people throw their reasoning and analytical powers straight out the window... and then will *actually argue with you and defend what they're doing* when you point it out to them. newlinechar  newlinechar It's sad to watch.
I did go back and read your first post, thanks. Perhaps you should remember that we don't have the benefit of your autobiography, so can only go by on what you say. For example, expressing a desire for 'traditional roles'. You seem to get very angry when anybody asks questions about your musing aloud, which I don't understand. newlinechar  newlinechar I have, actually, made some of the choices you are currently fretting over, and have friends and co-workers who have done the same. Sorry if you think experience is hostility.

If i can recall, it seems to be more prevelant in the tropical regions. But Malaria has been on their radar for a long time. There are already stratergies and plans for it. This is something new. If it mutates to something more virulent, I'll bet everyone will start to complain why they were so slow to act on it.
&gt; To me, it seems likely that our assumptions of the abstract Others will be dependent on the stories we are told about these Others. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not sure assumptions even need play into it.  It may be that all that's really happening in a case like that is the weakening of the conditions that drive social behavior.  It may, for instance, be a condition of human social impulses that we be able to identify the members of our social group in certain ways -- eg. according to their relationships to others within the group, as per Dunbar.  If nothing else, understanding the way relationships play out between the people we know gives us some indication of what we can expect from any given member of that group.  With people we don't know, we have no such indication.  In other words, it isn't the story will tell ourselves about them that matters so much as our uncertainty as to what story to tell. newlinechar  newlinechar If it's the case that our basic natural bonds are evolved to respond to certain conditions, then the perception that we belong to a social group where those conditions don't apply could easily entail a loosening of the sort of communal bonds we'd actually feel in a much more constrained but identifiable group.  So what I'm getting at is that our perceptions of those abstract others may not be entirely up to us.  I'm by no means a strict determinist when it comes to genetics, but I do think it likely takes more of a sustained effort to maintain a perception that's contrary to our evolved impulses, particularly when it comes to how we behave as social animals. newlinechar  newlinechar It may even be that in larger societies our default is to behave like a veritable pariah in most situations.  I have in mind the sort of attitude that a wolf will adopt when its acceptance into a pack is clearly conditional and tenuous.  Most of us likely have a core group that we go to whenever we can, who fit into our Dunbar set, and with whom we take up an attitude more like we would in pre-agricultural human societies.  But for most of any given day we move through a sea of unknown people who rarely rise above the level of visual familiarity.
Phew! Now we have foiled the illusion we willingly clicked a link to be bamboozled by. Take that perception! ... next!

Societies prosper *in spite of* their governments.  You do not appreciate the opportunity cost, nor compound interest, I think. newlinechar  newlinechar Capitalism did not cause the financial crisis, fractional reserve banking did.  and that system is institutionalized fraud, protected by anti-capitalist measures such as a central bank, legal tender laws, fiat currency, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason socialism doesn't work:   newlinechar The purest definition of socialism is the abolition of private property.  Without private property being exchange voluntarily between owners, there are no prices created that reflect the aggregate and marginal subjective wants of actors within the economy.  Without prices, there is no profit and loss, no economic calculation.  People managing resources are blind to the wants of the economy, and thus cannot possibly succeed in allocating and using resources in ways that society finds valuable. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why communist countries routinely built the wrong stuff, had massive famines, and spied on the west for prices.

I find the last bit of that parable to be an utterly bizarre bit of storytelling to attribute to Jesus.  Here we have someone saying in a parable that people will not listen to someone who has come back from the dead any more than they will listen to Moses.  That as a strategy, someone returning from the dead to warn the living will not work.  But that very same someone telling the parable is supposed to himself be on a mission which has as its culmination, him dying and returning from the dead to prove his godhood and knowledge about life after death and to warn the living.  Extremely bizarre.

For one thing, the term 'Zen master' is very much a Western conceit. Traditionally, you've got Zen teachers, who earn their qualifications from their own teachers. That doesn't mean they're ascended or enlightened, just that they have been given official permission to teach others that particular 'brand' of Zen.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As an aside: this guy reminds me of every Zen practitioner I've ever met (I'm American and have not traveled abroad, so my experience is limited). They all seem like deeply hurt individuals who desperately need something for solace. The longer they have been practicing, the more they seem to skirt around their emotions and affect implacable Yoda wisdom, but with this disconcerting 'edge' that makes me feel like they're going to explode into rage at any moment. By comparison, the religious Christians I have met seem genuinely at peace with themselves. I'm not sure why I have observed this phenomenon. newlinechar  newlinechar 
RMS probably wouldn't like you using the term 'open source' at all. newlinechar  newlinechar But why can't it be considered a win when cost is involved?

&gt;What's the problem with selling mortgages? newlinechar  newlinechar Where do I start? For one, it can be extremely stressful. Secondly, I never really got any long term satisfaction or feeling of growth. Sure, I might have a good sales month and get a nice bonus, but every month the numbers are reset and everything you have done up to that point doesn't matter at all. It felt very Sisyphean in that respect. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't look down on sales people. It is a great skill to be able to sell and certainly mortgage sales will allow a person with even just a high school education a good shot at making 6 figures (well, maybe not in this market but before). If it satisfies you mentally, more power to yah.  newlinechar  newlinechar I personally prefer the challenge of development.

Ok, well I think we should start doing that with children as well. If your child is larger than the other kids at school, and has the potential for being a bully, the parent must pay to become more 'vetted' than parents of small children.

If gay marriage is a slippery slope then that slope started with heterosexual marriage. If streamlining society and eliminating legal loopholes were the only considerations used to determine what kind of marriages were legal then the best thing to do seems to be to stop legally endorsing any marriage and let all legal rights be appointed by living wills, wills, power of attorneys, cohabitation contracts, alimony, palimony, etc. 
&gt;All this does is make every dad who has ever hit hard times in his life look like a deadbeat and further the social stigma attached to getting behind on your child support. newlinechar  newlinechar That's going to happen, anyway. There doesn't need to be a lifetime show about it. That's one of the reason MRA's who are more concerned with furthering men's rights than attacking and hating women should be agreeing with [what] feminists [are *actually* saying, not what the bugga-bugga-buggah conservative news *says* we say] that a man's worth more than a bank account and some muscle. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Whats ironic about this is, the only person who would put their children through this sort of ordeal are shitty mothers looking for some easy cash or some fame. Not mothers who care or worry about their children before all others. newlinechar  newlinechar Yep, those are some crappy moms who would do that to their kids. They make themselves look ridiculous, too. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;No wonder the dad left them and too bad he didn't get full custody. newlinechar  newlinechar One crappy parent doesn't negate the existence of another.

Well spoken outsider, newlinechar  newlinechar however I found some interesting scriptures the other day I thought I'd share.  The commandments weren't too hard to follow, they actually brought sin to life in man. newlinechar  newlinechar Romans 7:4  newlinechar  newlinechar In the same way, my brothers, you also were put to death to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead in order that we might bear fruit for God.  newlinechar  newlinechar 5  newlinechar  newlinechar For when we were in the flesh, our sinful passions, awakened by the law(commandments), worked in our members to bear fruit for death.  newlinechar  newlinechar 6  newlinechar  newlinechar But now we are released from the law, dead to what held us captive, so that we may serve in the newness of the spirit and not under the obsolete letter.  newlinechar  newlinechar 7  newlinechar  newlinechar 2 3 What then can we say? That the law is sin? Of course not! Yet I did not know sin except through the law, and I did not know what it is to covet except that the law said, 'You shall not covet.'  newlinechar  newlinechar 8  newlinechar  newlinechar But sin, finding an opportunity in the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetousness. Apart from the law sin is dead.  newlinechar  newlinechar 9  newlinechar  newlinechar I once lived outside the law, but when the commandment came, sin became alive;  newlinechar  newlinechar 10  newlinechar  newlinechar then I died, and the commandment that was for life turned out to be death for me.  newlinechar  newlinechar 11  newlinechar  newlinechar For sin, seizing an opportunity in the commandment, deceived me and through it put me to death.  newlinechar  newlinechar 12  newlinechar  newlinechar So then the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.  newlinechar  newlinechar 13  newlinechar  newlinechar 4 Did the good, then, become death for me? Of course not! Sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin, worked death in me through the good, so that sin might become sinful beyond measure through the commandment.  newlinechar  newlinechar 14  newlinechar  newlinechar We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold into slavery to sin.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Through Christ we are saved and you're right, following the two greatest commandments will keep us from sinning against each other.  Regardless, your view on not condemning other's lifestyles is right, who are we to judge since we are ALL sinners.

Perhaps he meant worldwide. But yes, there is an infinitesimally small chance that 30% could be killed. If the disease mutates into a more deadly strain with a 30% death rate, which has happened before (bubonic plague?), it could. Very unlikely, but it is a real chance.

&gt; Frankly I'm slightly concerned about ever trying to debate religion with such people, for fear of what might happen if you succeeded - rather than creating a more enlightened adult, you might find you've merely taken the brakes off a childish psychopath. newlinechar  newlinechar That's long bugged me too, quite honestly. What if a lot of people are just psychopaths? Or at least, a lot more people than we tend to think of as psychopaths. newlinechar  newlinechar It could explain part of the utility of religion for societies. If 30% of the population is naturally psychopathic (that is, they never get past [Kohlberg's level 1 morality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development)), the society would fail.

i'm sorry, i disagree. i don't think the catalyst for atrocities lies with '**one** guy' who was racist and decided to kill someone of another race using a holy book as justification. if the holy book never existed in the first place, there's a chance the seed that grew into hatred may never have been planted. newlinechar  newlinechar of course, some people are going to be naturally prejudiced. let's use homosexuality as an example. to some people, it doesn't seem natural and their base reaction to it is disgust. but lets say they've never met a gay person. never been around one ever. lets also say no holy book exists that says homosexuality is 'wrong'. maybe one day that person meets a homosexual person. they see the humanity in that person. they have a change of heart. this is very common. newlinechar  newlinechar without the reinforcement of something like the bible, i believe the potential to overcome prejudices over things people fear because they don't understand them has more of a chance. when you have a holy book that reinforces feelings you already have, it ingrains those feelings and your justification for having them so much more deeply in your mind. and when that happens, the potential for a person to develop a sociopathic  mindset over those feelings becomes greater with the right influences- IE, other religious people with the same prejudices reading the same holy book.  newlinechar  newlinechar you have to remember that as i stated above, people have natural prejudices against things they do not understand, but when some bronze age men take those prejudices and justify them in a holy book that they just made up based on their own thoughts and feelings and then turned around and said it was the words of a supreme being that rules over all the heavens and earth, people that believe them will have their own prejudices reinforced and they will feel justified in their bigotry. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: i'd also like to point out that people are often a product of their environment. look at the Phelps family. most of them listened to Fred Phelps and became hate mongers. a couple of them got away when they realized ol' Fred is just a psycho. when you raise a child to hate, chances are good they will grow up to hate. raise a child on peace a love and chances are good they will be a good person when they grow up. don't give your child a bible, give them a Bob Marley CD. it's all about peace and love, baby.

That makes logical sense even if it does not create a romantic interest in children for myself. newlinechar  newlinechar No comment on the physical?

It doesn't. It's been a hotly contested issue for a long time, because it's not particularly intuitive to have to queue short hops to get your vehicle to back up. However, once you know that's how it's done, it's a vastly more powerful tool for tank micro than a back button would be. newlinechar  newlinechar Doesn't particularly matter; it's super easy once you know how to do it, I was just using it as an example of tank quirks in CoH. Another good one is the critical system: tanks take critical hits, which aren't bonus damage, but rather status effects (immobilized, damaged engine, gunner killed, etc). Once you get to red health, there are a few destruction criticals (tank destroyed, out of control, etc). The funny thing is, at 5% health *tanks stop taking damage*. Criticals are a separate roll, so each shot is roll for damage, then roll for critical. At 5% health, the chance of a 'destroy' critical is really high, but NOT 100%, so you'll see tanks shrug off a few hits at 5% before dying sometimes. It's commonly known, and it's a weird issue, but not particularly game-breaking.

&gt;Why would you want to pay someone, who is leaving you? That makes as much sense as being excited to pay taxes. newlinechar  newlinechar You are making the assumption that it is the partner leaving you and not you leaving the partner. You are also ignoring the possibility of an amicable breakup. Albeit not a marriage, but my last long-term boyfriend and I are on very good terms. We talk just about every week. I learned a lot from him and am a better person for having been with him. Part of my ability to succeed was because of what he did and the environment I had to come home to. He cooked dinner, he brewed my coffee every morning. He did the laundry. He did everything at home so that I could succeed outside of it. If anything, my only regret is that I ultimately was unable to repay him for that. newlinechar  newlinechar Distribution of assets isn't there to punish *or* reward... it's there as a recognition of what each person contributed to the unit and a safety net for the spouse who was less successful outside of the home.

This is all just a personal theory. I haven't read or seen anyone else who supports this as it relates to suicide But I'm sure there out there. 
The problem is that they cherry pick which parts of the Bible they want to follow and ignore the rest. For instance Evangelical Fundamentalists in the US they quote Old Testament verses against homosexuality that are contained in Mosaic Law, but ignore other Mosaic Laws that outlaw wearing two kinds of cloth at the same time, eating of pork and shellfish, and hundreds of others as well as the writings of the Apostle Paul in the New Testament who says that Christians are no longer held to the Mosaic Law. Everyone picks the part of their religion that they like and ignore other parts, but fundamentalist Christians in the US claim that they are following all of the Bible when they are doing no such thing. They aren’t even following the teachings of Jesus himself who preached love of all, turning the other cheek and praying for enemies rather than seeking vengeance. Instead many of them seem to worship the character John Rambo and call him Christ.

As a woman I can say this is the A++ 100% right answer. I used to work in a very similar job and the guys who chatted me up a bit and built a relationship, no matter how slight, always started to feel like work friends. Friends = not creepy. Not creepy = I wouldn't mind going somewhere else with you. If you follow this advice I promise you if she likes you she will go out with you. A cold will you go out with me will leave her with WAY too many unanswered questions about your serial killer potential. Most girls will shoot you down immediately even if they are slightly interested because they just don’t trust random guys and you have put her on the spot too fast.

&gt; My mother, like your friend, was also in the legal profession. She, too, refused to 'present herself as a victim'. She worked twice as hard to be thought half as good without acting as though she noticed. She never complained about the blatant and obvious discrimination around her - I'm talking about things like senior partners announcing to the staff 'No broad is going to be partner if I can help it'. And while she certainly was more successful than if she'd collapsed into a puddle of tears, that didn't make the discrimination and unfairness magically evaporate. newlinechar  newlinechar Where did I suggest that it would evaporate? I didn't even suggest that my friend was not discriminated against. I suggested that she doesn't choose to view the world in a matter where she presents her self as such. I suspect this fortitude played a role in your mom's success and your success.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You conflate recognizing that discrimination exists with 'presenting as a victim' and 'viewing yourself as a victim' (those are two different things, btw). newlinechar  newlinechar no, I do not. Recognizing discrimination and harping on it are 2 different things. Presenting yourself as a victim makes you look weak. Recognizing that discrimination exists does not. Viewing yourself as a victim (to societal things) is, likewise, not a step towards success. Each person is different, but most people who view themselves as a victim fall into a trap of having this victimhood take control.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And those obstacles do not go away if we refuse to pretend they exist; in fact, we reinforce them, because those who put up the obstacles point to us as counter-examples.  newlinechar  newlinechar Facing a unique obstacle doesn't make you a victim. This is a frame of mind. victim mentality makes others perceive you as weak.  newlinechar  newlinechar

The first major evidence for the existence of purgatory is the constant Christian (and Jewish, before that) practice of praying for the dead.  The dead in hell cannot be helped by prayer, and the dead in heaven have no need for prayer, so if it's reasonable to pray for the dead, then there must be some additional purgatorial state in which prayers can assist the dead.  In fact, it was the loss of the belief in purgatory which caused the widespread practice among Protestants of not praying for the dead. newlinechar  newlinechar Biblically, we see praying for the dead in 2 Maccabbees (12, I believe), and in one of Paul's letters (2 Timothy) where he prays for Onesiphorus, who had almost certainly died.  Note that Paul speaks of Onesiphorus in the past tense, that he prays that he 'find mercy from God in that day,' and that he only greets Onesiphorus' *house* rather greeting Onesiphorus himself. newlinechar  newlinechar Apart from that evidence, there are a few passages we interpret as referring to purgatory.  When Paul wrote to the Corinthians, 'Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw—each one’s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, *but only as through fire.*'  We believe that 'fire' to refer to suffering in purgatory. newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, Christ, when teaching us to seek reconciliation with others, told us 'Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.'  We believe Jesus to be referring to purgatory as that prison we will not escape until we have paid the last penny. newlinechar  newlinechar There are a few other teachings of Christ which simply don't make much sense without a concept of purgatory.  Consider Matthew 12, where Christ teaches about the unforgivable sin.  He says, 'whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.'  If 'the age to come' consists only of hell and heaven, that statement makes no sense: in hell there is no forgiveness and in heaven there is no need for forgiveness.  If 'the age to come' has a purgatorial state, however, there is forgiveness which will be granted in it, and Christ's statement makes sense. newlinechar  newlinechar Similarly, consider Christ's parable of Lazarus and Dives ('the Rich Man').  Dives shows compassion on his brothers by desiring that Abraham go to them and warn them of his suffering.  But compassion itself will not exist in hell, since it is a gracious gift of God, and hell consists of separation from God.  And, of course, there will be no suffering in heaven: Dives was in purgatory, where he was experiencing the suffering due for his sins, suffering that Lazarus had felt (as a poor beggar) already in his life.

If they tell anyone what they were told in the briefings, they're guilty of treason. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if someone like Pelosi were brave enough to blow the whistle on this sort of thing, knowing full well that doing so meant going to federal prison, I'd consider her a real hero, and I'd do all I could to push for a full pardon. But it would certainly be the end of her political career, and who knows how much time she'd be spending in the clink before (if) she was pardoned. newlinechar  newlinechar How many of us really expect that level of personal sacrifice from legislators?

Of course not. But if you were gay (for example) and you had a problem with it, you could choose not to have sex, and you could work to avoid thinking about it. There will obviously be times when the thought would come unbidden, but it is your choice whether you dwell on it and pursue it, or allow the thought to pass. newlinechar  newlinechar With paedophilia, then surely that would be the only way you could stay sane? Wouldn't you need a coping strategy? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm gonna go out on a limb here and actually profess some measure of sympathy for non-active paedophiles. Kind of. Of all the kinks, twists and fetishes, it is one of the few that is not only arguably unhealthy (could be caused by/symptom of some dysfunction/aberration  of biology or psychology) but also universally regarded as wrong (and, imho, rightfully so) - only other things I can think of that fit in that category would be scat (unhealthy, but I wouldn't say wrong), snuff (should be obvious) and rape / anything non-consensual (wrong, varying degrees of unhealthy). The end result being an uncontrollable urge with no possible happy ending - if you act on it, somebody -will- get hurt. newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds like a great recipe for lifelong torment, to me. newlinechar  newlinechar That said: we're thinking beings, fully aware of others being like ourselves; we're empathic. We know when we're harming someone; we know right from wrong. As soon as you cross the line and hurt someone, my sympathy ends. newlinechar  newlinechar The OP scares and angers me because throughout the thread he's justifying it by saying he 'loves' them, and is trying his damndest to make a case that it doesn't necessarily mean harm. This sounds very much like the precursor to action, rather than the words of someone who is in an effective programme.

The aggressor wasn't simply saying that the kid is Chinese.  He used the phrase to specifically call attention to the kid's race as a negative feature.  This is significant especially because the town has a history of hostility towards Asians. newlinechar  newlinechar I may be off base with this comparison, but here goes:  It's my understanding that the term 'paki' is considered a slur in the UK.  This would be true even if you were describing a Pakistani person.  Since I've only ever read it, not heard it, my first thought as an American was that it seems like a reasonable descriptor.  However, it's the history and intention that makes it a slur.

Yes, I had great fun in the demo by just reloading the same part again and again and coming up with different ways to kill the same guys.

Hope there are lots more ways to cause mayhem.

Or you could simply make the assumption that if there is actually a god, he simply isn't as all-knowing as he pretends to be; that would be quite consistent with the bible. For example, Omniscient god says: 'wait, they're going to eat from the tree if I make it? Alright. Better not put that there.' Not-so-omniscient god says: 'Hm, that tree kind of looks nice in the garden. Eve, what do you think? Yummy, eh? Anyways, don't eat from it or I'll have to torture you and your kids for eternity.

Do you *ever* experience attraction to a woman in the same way that you are attracted to children? newlinechar  newlinechar Some women carry less of a burden of pain than others -- they are less angry/bitchy. I'm wondering if it is this attribute that attracts you to children (who, being younger, have suffered less, and are more trusting and curious). If it is, then hope is not lost if you can find the right woman. newlinechar  newlinechar Btw, I think it's possible to dissipate sexual feelings w/o suppression or masturbation, by generating inner body awareness.  newlinechar  newlinechar IMO no kind of sex can provide lasting satisfaction, only an imperfect kind of relief (which becomes more and more short-lived as awareness grows).
Actually, you do have to get permission. From your own link: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Since the Copyright Act of 1909, there has been a right to cover someone else's song in the United States.[7] A license can be specifically negotiated between representatives of the covering artist and the copyright holder, or cover songs can fall under a mechanical license whereby the covering artist pays a standard royalty to the original artist through an organization such as the Harry Fox Agency, and is safe under copyright law even if they do not have any permission from the original artist.

Not taking into account her discomfort means he's really not ready for a relationship.  You have to have that baseline empathy to make things work.  Not having that baseline empathy for the girl you potentially want to fall in love in...well, it contradicts your desire and makes you a douchebag.
This is exactly what I haven't seen.  In my experience in a traditionally male dominated career the women rise to the top much faster.  So a woman might be getting paid less than a man but she also probably has less experience with the company and will be on to the next job (along with a pay raise) while the male plods along.  I'm not denying the statistics but I do have to question the validity of them when you start looking at things on a case by case basis. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  Also as I stated in another post, the people ultimately making hiring and salary decisions are more often than not female. newlinechar  newlinechar This is all just my experience though which might very well be completely atypical.  I don't work in a field like law or banking which I've heard is still a bit more 'good ol' boys' dominated.

That's an interesting paper.  I think the fact that literature like this exists on Ender's Game is a pretty good indication that it's not toss-off kid's fiction, but rather a work of some merit even if it is compromised by a flawed moral agenda.   newlinechar  newlinechar I remember when I read this book and I was really horrified by what Ender did; it was a similar experience to reading Lord of the Flies.  I understood the need to hurt a bully enough to make him not want to come for you again.  And I remember feeling not that Ender was some kind of saint who 'had' to kill the aliens, but rather that he was a victim of the adults around him who basically raised him to be a monster.  I thought the book was an interesting study on how both someone who starts evil (like Peter) and someone who starts relatively good (like Ender) can both do an incredible amount of damage, even if the good one doesn't mean to.

Actually, the hot coffee thing was not a totally frivolous suit and only went to court after McDonalds repeatedly refused to compensate the woman.  Yes, the woman accidentally spilled the coffee on herself.

&gt;You sure have a lot more shit to debunk than thermite.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm just talking about the paper.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Do you really think that was a plane that hit the Pentagon?  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If you were a terrorist, why would you want to crash into the outside when everyone knows more important shit is toward the interior? newlinechar  newlinechar Because there is a giant wall and if you are in a plane you can't just open the door to the pentagon before you fly into it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And by the way, why wasn't there a plane found at all?  newlinechar  newlinechar Because it hit the wall of the pentagon, all they found were plane parts and what was in the plane. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Why did the lease of the WTC change hands two weeks before the attacks, into the hands of a billionaire private investor who then immediately has a huge insurance policy drawn up that granted him 5 billion in profit? newlinechar  newlinechar Because the lease had been awarded 2 weeks prior, that's just how it worked out.  The owner had got insurance because that's what owners do, they insure their property.  Just like you have car insurance when you buy a car.  You don't wait months before you get car insurance, you get car insurance when you buy a car.  Same type of thing here. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;How does two planes cause three buildings to fall in the same exact manner? newlinechar  newlinechar I assume you don't mean exact.  they all fell via progressive collapse.  there are a few technical papers written about how that happens.  You'll have to read them.  As for the cause the NIST report does a fairly good job of explaining it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Wouldn't there be, you know, some fucking variation of fire caused one collapse and planes caused the other two? newlinechar  newlinechar Again, you'll have to read more about progressive collapse. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If the composition of jet-fuel is pretty much equivalent to kerosene, shouldn't the grill of a barbecue pit collapse if kerosene was poured into the fire for a long enough period of time? newlinechar  newlinechar No. Your BBQ isn't the same as WTC 1,2&amp;7.  They are made differently and have different shapes and supports. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What vested interest do international scientists have to fabricate a study to show thermite was in the WTC dust? newlinechar  newlinechar Because one of the authors sells quite a few books and advertisements off the publicity.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Somebody from Denmark, where's the motive to lie? newlinechar  newlinechar Don't know, you'll have to ask him.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You're an idiot and a troll.  newlinechar  newlinechar great... well I doubt you're really interested in a response anyway.

That comment is beyond genius on so many levels.  I tip my hat off to you.
I was replying to another post when I came up with a few arguments that I think are valid. Please consider them for a moment. Both rely on the presumption that harming the child is unacceptable, and that harm must be something that is universally considered as harm. newlinechar  newlinechar 1)STDs: Even condoms won't protect from every disease, and they can just break during intercourse. There is a chance you're carrying a disease even if you've tested negative. I'll agree this isn't something that's likely to happen, but this is something where you could harm the child even if you took all precautions possible. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it's a fair assumption that children who understand statistics to the degree that they could make an informed decision about this do not exist. They won't understand how likely getting a disease is, nor do they understand the full implications of what living with something like HIV means, nor can they afford to treat any disease they might contract (a pre-emptive argument: 'I'd take care of them if that happened' simply means they'd become dependent on you, and would no longer in a position to abandon the relationship.) newlinechar  newlinechar 2)Children have not yet formed a sexual identity. The bad scenario here would be if a girl consented, then later on discovered she was a lesbian and your encounter with her would become a source of self-loathing. Again, there's nothing you could do to prevent this from happening. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: Since you said that you desire 'a rationally convincing argument against pedophilia', I assumed this would be the type of reply you wanted. Should I have written it as a question instead (re: the edit to your starting post)?

It's different really. It's hard to explain. The relationship between me and a person of my own age will provide the intellectual fulfillment and partnership that I desire (presuming that possess certain qualities), whether as a child would fulfill some of more basic, and simple, in both senses of the word, needs.  newlinechar  newlinechar If I was to choose to have a relationship with either of the two I would choose a child; due to the difficulty of finding one that meets my requirements (capacity for one) and the problems of engaging the relationship. I could always find a suitable partner of my own age elsewhere, and a lot easier. newlinechar  newlinechar If I could only have one relationship then it would be with a partner my own age, because I value the qualities they exemplify more than the more basic attraction to the child.

Despite the awful things you hear about lobbyists, for the most part we're just forging a link between constituents and policymakers.

[Morbo]MARKDOWN DOES NOT WORK LIKE THAT[/Morbo] 
&gt;&gt; SQL has an incredibly verbose syntax SQL syntax is massively redundant newlinechar &gt; newlinechar &gt; So does Java. newlinechar  newlinechar Which is also a pretty awful language, at least as far as its syntax is concerned. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This is more a personal dislike than a valid criticism of the engineering behind SQL. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think so. To some extent any criticism of a programming language is subjective. Programming languages are a form of user interface, so what one person likes, another person might absolutely hate. newlinechar  newlinechar Nevertheless, we can identify quantifiable properties that can be considered to be generally desirable. Conciseness is one of these quantities - ideally we want to allow the most clear representation of a program in the minimum of screen space. newlinechar  newlinechar If we take this as our yardstick, then any verbosity that does not increase clarity can be considered as bad. For instance: newlinechar  newlinechar     students &lt;&lt; ('John Smith') newlinechar  newlinechar Is less verbose, but no less clear than: newlinechar  newlinechar     INSERT INTO students VALUES ('John Smith') newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Again, this is an opportunity for syntax optimisation rather than a crippling fault with the language. newlinechar  newlinechar None of my objections are 'crippling faults'. SQL can be used as a query language, so clearly there's nothing in the syntax bad enough to prevent it from being used. But that doesn't mean it's not an extremely awful language. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; A major idea behind SQL and relational databases is to specifically avoid creating intermediary structures, as they're usually a waste of time and memory, and complicate optimisation. newlinechar  newlinechar Not if the structures are lazily evaluated. Then there's zero overhead, and optimisation would actually be a lot easier for the compiler. newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps I should have been more clear, but why would you assume that I'd be strictly evaluating variables in a query language? Query languages are all about lazy evaluation. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; do you have any other examples of why SQL is actually a *bad* language newlinechar  newlinechar Okay, aside from it being verbose, redundant and restrictive, it's also ridiculously hard to parse, and poor at integrating with other systems. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider a query language designed as Lisp-like syntax tree: newlinechar  newlinechar     (select newlinechar       (= .subject_name 'History') newlinechar       (join students subjects)) newlinechar  newlinechar With such a language, you could pass it to the database server as an AST, rather than a string. This would allow for greater integration into programming languages, as well as efficiency and security benefits. For example, some Ruby code could look like: newlinechar  newlinechar     def history_students newlinechar       students.join(subjects).select { |t| t.student_name.eq 'History' } newlinechar     end newlinechar  newlinechar If that looks a little like an ORM, you'd be correct. Most well-build ORMs use an internal AST to build up a database query, which is then serialized into a SQL statement, which is then compiled back into an equivalent AST. newlinechar  newlinechar Because SQL is a language with an unnecessarily complex grammar, parsing a sane AST into the insanity that is SQL is not a task to be taken lightly. SQL does not lend itself to be easily read or written by machines. newlinechar  newlinechar It would be infinitely simpler, more efficient, and less prone to error to just pass over the AST in the first place.

What questions did you actually ask that I missed?  Reading back it seems you have assumed your way through my replies without clear questions. You were upset I didn't include a breakdown of my life, and then went on a tangent about responsibility sharing in a relationship. I did respond on responsibility sharing, but I don't see how who takes out the trash on Tuesdays is really going to add to the discussion.  What remains unanswered is the original indecision, about which not having an easy answer is actually the whole point.  newlinechar  newlinechar Let me rephrase my original point without the 'I's or the genders: Is a person discriminated against if a child reduces her/his performance at a job, either technically or time-wise, to the point where she/he doesn't advance in a career?  Are people simply trying to do too much, to the point where neither path is ultimately satisfying or excelled at?  Having it all has a cost as well, and how do you figure that into your life's 'calculations'? newlinechar  newlinechar What choices did you make? They're clearly important to your argument so I'm surprised you haven't given details about your own experience, at least to support your assumptions. I'm interested to hear how what you chose has worked out for you.
There is much truth about the Human condition in fiction, and I think that Lolita refutes your view well. newlinechar  newlinechar It is true that Athenian Pedastry did have some problems, but by and large it (and Pedastry in many other cultures) was something enjoyed by both parties. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact is that not all pedophilia relationships are abusive; some are consensual. It may be that the potential for abuse is inversely proportional to the difference in age, but that is a different argument.

I learned something fascinating about the psychology of paedophilic priests in my abnormal psych course, actually. newlinechar  newlinechar When you are a kid, you are naturally attracted to people of your same age.  As you age, this attraction ages. newlinechar  newlinechar When you enter the Seminary, or are otherwise forbidden from even feeling sexual impulses, this attraction is buried completely. newlinechar  newlinechar While buried, it stops aging. newlinechar  newlinechar When it reemerges, it reemerges as it was the last time it existed, before the were removed of it so many years ago, and with the same target as it had so many years ago. newlinechar  newlinechar Naturally, this is an over generalization, but is considered true for a large number of priests by a substantial body of psychology, and as far as I'm concerned DOES make a lot of sense.

BitTorrent - Run with encryption on and set it to only accept other encrypted clients. Also, keep your uploads low (leeching sucks, but most cases are based off of only uploading pirated content and not downloading) newlinechar  newlinechar For all apps, use a list blocker like Peer Guardian (blocks known IPs for certain agencies and honeypots). This provides a small level of security, since they use a lot of IPs that are dynamic.  But, better than nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as getting music, use a smaller network like Soulseek instead of BitTorrent.  Why?  Well, they have all the content most other networks have, less viruses, and the #1 reason -- they're so much smaller that the RIAA doesn't care about them. newlinechar  newlinechar Keep in mind for everything:  the less you upload, the less likely you are to get caught. newlinechar  newlinechar If you really wanted to be secure, use a free public proxy with encryption.  It's slower, but if you run your downloads over night then it won't matter.  Either that or use an anonymous file sharing service.  The lesser known a service is, the more likely you won't get caught. newlinechar  newlinechar There are other less known methods that work really well, but I choose not to post them.

First of all, it is indeed brave of you to come here and answer these questions, and bear these rants. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I must disagree with your above statement. There is a fundamental difference in the level of power an adult holds over a child and that an adult holds over another adult. newlinechar  newlinechar In your most potent example, a healthy BDSM relationship is discussed by the two entering into it and has a 'safe word' type of situation when the sub feels things have gone too far. This relationship hinges on the fact that the sub has the ability to comprehend how far is too far and knows exactly what he or she wants. newlinechar  newlinechar A child is conditioned (except in some extreme cases) to trust adults and a relationship between a child and an adult will contain a level of completely naive trust in the goodwill of the adult that is likely to taint the child's ability to reason about what they do and don't want. In other words, I can't imagine it is possible to determine if a child really wants to engage in sexual acts or if they would simply agree because they trust the adult that it is a good thing. To build on your example of the age of criminal responsibility, it is much easier to understand that doing something bad to someone else is wrong than it is that letting someone do something sexual to you might psychologically damage you, as kernelhappy said. newlinechar  newlinechar I understand your argument that some people may be sexually mature and able to consent before their country's legal age of consent, but as wattmolloy said I can't imagine a system that would allow for case-by-case determination of this maturity. It is much more effective and safe to be overcautious to protect the outlying cases of those that take the longest to sexually mature. newlinechar  newlinechar The only harm I see from our current system is in cases where, for example, a 16-17 year old has consenting sex with their 18 year old significant other and a vindictive parent sues for statutory rape. Or cases where the younger person happens to be more sexually mature than the older person that is actually being victimized. I would posit that it is more effective to deal with these corner cases as exceptions when they occur, although I know that this does not usually happen and some people are unjustly jailed. newlinechar  newlinechar All that said, as long as you do understand how likely acting on your desires is to end up disturbing a child and decide that this risk is unacceptable, I can't really be upset at you for your orientation, and I can sympathize with the difficulty this must cause you.
Everyone knows that a real genie won't grant a wish for more wishes.
I don't agree with stopping doing something just because it's illegal, I tend to stand up for what I think is fair. Breaking the law is a right, and I'm willing to accept the punishment should I get caught. newlinechar  newlinechar Saying that, I do agree with what you are saying. I should 'stop comsuming the product'. It's why I started using Linux instead of Windows. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, about 5 years ago I deleted my illegal music collection and start a purely legal collection (mostly through eMusic + shops). But, at least here in the UK, it wasn't easy.  newlinechar  newlinechar In today culture you share music with your friends and lots of music is only available illegally. Online catalogs are very limited and have been laden with DRM (I wont pay for music that wont work on all my devices) or that is exorbitantly expensive (I'm not paying £1 per song. Ever). newlinechar  newlinechar In the past 5 years I've done well and only pirated about 50 albums, way less than I have legally paid for, and most of those are pirated off friends. Also recently some new services like spotify have started which are good and I don't mind paying for. newlinechar  newlinechar Still, there is not a single legal option to download movies from the internet and going to the cinema is an horrific experience (kids talking on the phone and chatting through most of the film) that I don't wish to repeat unless it is a really good film. Plus it's difficult to organize with friends. I have a LoveFilm subscription but it's slow and you don't get the films you want, when you want them. Bittorrent in compassion takes 20 minutes to download and have streaming to my TV. newlinechar  newlinechar When I can buy a service at a reasonable price and quality I have no problem shelling out the money. I think it's important to reward artists with
Fine, we'll call it a 'dostak' so nobody gets upset. newlinechar  newlinechar I willingly agreed to the dostak. I knew, or if I'd gotten off my ass could easily have informed myself, that the dostak would impose certain legal requirements on me and my spouse as to who was considered to own what, and if we divorce, how our income and property would be divided (and whether we had continuing obligations after the dissolution). newlinechar  newlinechar So, again, can you please explain to me why I should now be able to stomp my little feet and argue that I don't want to be held to the terms of the dostak, because even though I agreed to them, it's unfaaaaaaair?

Well, for a succinct but informed survey I'd suggest checking out E.E. Evans-Pritchard's *Theories of Primitive Religion*.  But the short version is that Frazer didn't do his own field research.  He was collating partial research from field workers, and not all of that research was particularly thorough.  In some cases it was even dishonest.  This was at the beginning of systematic anthropology, of course, and the whole thing was still evolving into a more disciplined practice, so I'm inclined to sympathize with Frazer, but some of the basic concepts he puts forward (eg. the progressive evolution of religion from animism to theism) are questionable.  So far as I know, the current state of anthropology no longer subscribes to the Taylor/Frazer models. newlinechar  newlinechar Which isn't to say that there's no good material in *The Golden Bough*.  It's an amazing book in its own right.  It's just difficult to discern the wheat from the chaffe without reference to some more systematically researched work.

It also depends on the girl. They could be trying to be cool, or they could just be boring.

&gt;There is much truth about the Human condition in fiction newlinechar  newlinechar I love fiction, but in this case, imo, it doesn't provide a valid substantiation of the point. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;but by and large it (and Pedastry in many other cultures) was something enjoyed by both parties. newlinechar  newlinechar Can you support that view? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The fact is that not all pedophilia relationships are abusive; some are consensual. newlinechar  newlinechar I can persuade my five-year-old to consent to virtually anything I want her to consent to...and, that's really the fundamental point that makes your argument fall apart.

They need to be legally protected from the evil in this world. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It may be that the potential for abuse is inversely proportional to the difference in age, but that is a different argument. newlinechar  newlinechar So true. And, it's not a different argument. It's this argument. It's the reason why all pedophilia relationships are abusive: the difference in age allows for one to manipulate another's liberty in a way not easily understood for the victim.

It's kind of like the classic definition of 'vegetarian' isn't used anymore. You either eat some form of meat or you're vegan.

Good work, detective.
Not sure if you're addressing the question to me--'What is it about the sexual encounter with adults is 'harmful'?--but I think it's a good question and I'll  have a shot at answering from my own experience. newlinechar  newlinechar Sucking my older half-brother's cock when I was nine... Damage? Compared to his beating the shit out of me on a daily basis, you'd think sucking his horrible cock would be less damaging. But over the years it was the cocksucking that proved more damaging. It seems to have taught me that I could only be liked if I went along with sex I didn't want.  newlinechar  newlinechar First sexual abuse by an adult at the age of 12. Vomited immediately afterwards for some reason. Damage? Well, like with most child abuse, it was an adult who'd wormed his way into my life (befriending my foster family), someone who'd won my trust and affection: the betrayal of trust was maybe more sickening than the experience itself (waking up to find him sucking my cock).  newlinechar  newlinechar From 13 on I became something like a prostitute the way I attracted men: somewhere to sleep, someone to tell me I was special, all that... So now I knew I was instigating it and told myself I could handle it: just physical, forgettable, meaningless. Damage? Every time I've slept with someone I didn't want to it's created some alienating distance from my body.It's hard to say what it would have been like if it hadn't happened--but I can just about remember having a protective feeling towards my body before all that happened: those experiences disconnected me in some way that's not easy to articulate. Above all, it made me feel like a predator when I was with my girlfriends: I could easily imagine them having gone along with sex with me just as I went along with sex with those people I was disgusted by. Sex became even more complicated than it already was, I guess.  newlinechar  newlinechar So, apart from loss of trust and perhaps what some would call loss of 'innocence', what else have been the consequences?  newlinechar  newlinechar Doesn't help your self-esteem much to let something happen to you in the most intimate way when you didn't want that to happen--but I guess my self-esteem must have been pretty low to let it happen in the first place.  newlinechar  I don't think having sex with men when I was younger was too good for me socially (!). At school, for example, you're sitting there trying to get over what happened the night before while your classmates are swapping football cards. I even enjoyed the difference and tried to see myself as some kind of rebel. But that was a narcissitic defence I wouldn't recommend to anyone -- life as a film that only you are watching.  newlinechar  newlinechar Long-term psychological damage? I don't know how to quantify it... Was it the sexual encounters that have led me to be a hopeless failure or was it the circumstances which led to that happening so often? (Or was it genetic, etc...)  newlinechar  newlinechar The point I'm trying to make to paedo here is that an adult is in a unique position of power when it comes to children (not usefully comparable to a boss in relation to an employee). Our responsibility as adults is to protect children--from ourselves above all, perhaps--not to confuse them or betray whatever trust they put in us. If a child has somehow got themselves into a sexual relationship with an adult, I'd bet that child is really looking for something else from that adult. How could one forgive oneself for adding another fuck-up factor to their life?    newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt; Those are fair arguments - I assumed you were criticising SQL's utility as a query language, but if I understand you correctly you're instead criticising it's verbosity and imprecise, inconsistent grammar - correct? newlinechar  newlinechar That's basically correct.

Do you mean the concept of a relational database? In which case, yep, I have nothing against that particular form of database. newlinechar  newlinechar It's basically the syntax of SQL I have a problem with, and the idea of using a human-readable language as a communications protocol between two programs.

If I used that as evidence, I could surely out do you, as the list of popular figures that are not truthers and have come out publicly as such is much larger than the ones that have come out as truthers.

He hasn't gone through proper peer review channels, and while he has always been critical of the official investigation, he himself appears to be making the same mistakes he claims were made.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example he's critical that no samples were taken that could be studied, but he's the sole  possessor for some  supposed samples that supposedly contain some sort of thermate in them. He's not sharing, he's only doing his personal  analysis.

Did you ever try doing any mind games yourself?  Perhaps when you were younger?
I'm sorry you were abused. Genuinely. I can't imagine what that must have been like, and I won't insult what you went through by doing so.  newlinechar  newlinechar When I walk out of the hospital with my kid, I'll probably realise that I don't know how to change a daiper. But thats the least important part of parenting. The most important part is who you are, the values you can pass on, your atitudes, your sense of humor. That's not going to change when I walk out of the delivery room.  newlinechar  newlinechar You can, and probably will, come back arguing that 'You just won't know until you have one'. You don't know anything about me, so how can you be qualified to make that statement? newlinechar  newlinechar As to your example of me teaching my speciality, the quality of this analogy is laughable! I hope I know more than my students. Thats not the fucking point.  newlinechar  newlinechar If I am a fucking awful teacher, they see the mistakes that I make every day. They know where I fail to explain something, or skip a detail. They know if I don't give a shit about their papers. They know if I don't answer emails, or phone calls, or am never there to help.  newlinechar  newlinechar If they have _half_ a brain cell, they've already thought to themselves 'a teacher shouldn't do this. If I were a teacher, I'd do it this way'. And in that way, they'd probably become a better teacher, and it would have NOTHING to do with how much each one knows.  newlinechar  newlinechar If I said that my dad beat me (he didn't), and I learnt then how not-to-parent, would you say: newlinechar  newlinechar 'That's laughable, it'll all change when you have a kid'?!?

That's fair enough. Just as an observation though: it seems in general these comments are uncomfortable about the subject.

No, not really.  If you're arrogant and right you can achieve great things.  If you're arrogant and wrong you can't.  If you're humble and right, you may not achieve great things because you have trouble getting people to join you.  If you're humble and wrong, you may not do much damage because you have trouble gaining a following. newlinechar  newlinechar Conservatives are often arrogant because they see things in black and white.  They can be right or wrong.  Liberals are often humble because they see things in shades of grey.  They can be right or wrong.  Think about it.  Who is more often painted as being wishy washy / flip floppers -- democrats or republicans? newlinechar  newlinechar Both parties can fail because of corruption or being out of touch with the people they represent, but failing because of arrogance is much more likely with conservatives.

I absolutely love the music on this album. I'd only heard of Grandaddy recently when one of their songs showed up in a car commercial (actually, that seems to be how I find a lot of music, ever since Nick Drake's Pink Moon showed up in a VW commercial 10 or so years ago).  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to talk about the lyrics in this post, because I was absolutely blown away by them, not only as individual songs, but also how well the songs seem to fit together into a coherent whole. newlinechar  newlinechar He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot - This one's fairly ambiguous, I'm not sure who '2000 man' is, perhaps just the singer himself. This song seems to be, on the most basic level, about someone who's reaching for something amazing but who is being pulled down by outside pressure from people without the vision he has. The reason I think it might be about the singer is because, from what I can tell, Grandaddy was very much about trying to not get caught up in the corporate music game and focusing instead on writing quality music. newlinechar  newlinechar Hewlett's Daughter - I'm not sure about this one either, I'm not sure who Hewlett is supposed to be, unless it's a reference to one of the founders of Hewlett-Packard. Since this one's pretty packed with apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic imagery, perhaps it's about the destruction of humanity brought about by technology. Awfully poppy and catchy for such a heavy subject, though. newlinechar  newlinechar Jed the Humanoid - I also love this song. On a literal level, the song is about creating a robot and then growing bored with him and forgetting about him, until he eventually becomes lonely and ends his life. On a more metaphorical level, it seems to be about the tendency of society to quickly adopt newer technologies and abandoned older ones, which definitely has ethical implications if we ever do create a true artificial intelligence. newlinechar  newlinechar The Crystal Lake - About being stuck somewhere (a place, or perhaps even a time, or period of time) and wanting to return to a beautiful place where you once were. Given the context of the album, it might be about losing one's self in technology and wanting to return to a time when things seemed simpler and clearer and more beautiful. newlinechar  newlinechar Chartsengrafs - Not much to say about this one, except that it sounds a bit like a Built to Spill song, which I enjoy. newlinechar  newlinechar Underneath the Weeping Willow - Very pretty song, similar lyrical concepts to 'The Crystal Lake.' newlinechar  newlinechar Broken Household Appliance National Forest - This one actually makes a whole lot of sense to me. About a place where the old unwanted household appliance wind up. Perhaps a dump or junkyard, but not necessarily. I see two possible interpretations for this song. The first, that one day humanity will disappear (perhaps destroyed in the events mentioned in 'Hewlett's Daughter?) and our sole legacy will be forests of broken appliances; the second relating back to themes from 'Jed the Humanoid,' about humanity's tendancy to quickly discard the old in favor of the new, and wasteful tendencies in general. newlinechar  newlinechar Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground) - A companion piece with 'Jed the Humanoid,' this one just drives home for me how human Jed really was, and how much more tragic it makes his end. newlinechar  newlinechar E. Knievel Interlude (The Perils of Keeping It Real) - obviously, nothing going on lyrically here, but I dunno how I feel about saying 'skip it.' I'm just not sure what it's trying to say, I get a sense of winding down in this song. Perhaps Jed winding down, since it comes right after a song about him. newlinechar  newlinechar Miner at the Dial-A-View - Great song. This one seems to be about living your life through a virtual world. Sitting at a computer and observing life taking place, instead of going out and actually living a real life and experiencing it for yourself. This song might also be speaking to the addictiveness of technology. newlinechar  newlinechar So You'll Aim Toward the Sky - A simple song, I like how it ties the whole album together, with what seems to be a reference to the first track, 'He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot.' The person is rising above everything, reaching for the sky. Also perhaps escaping from technology, in search of the crystal lake? I'm not sure, but I do like how a song with so few words can so effectively bring together a lot of the themes in this album. newlinechar  newlinechar Overall, I get the sense that this album is about humanity's obsession with technology at the cost of the simple beauty of nature, and the tendency to become to lose sight of our humanity in the face of technological advancement. newlinechar  newlinechar So, wow, long post. These are just my thoughts off the top of my head listening through the album again. I'd love to hear anyone else's thoughts on it. newlinechar 
Bad analogy, because *you* aren't the boss--the boss is a group of many citizens.  Collectively, you decide to all chip in so that your democratically-chosen leader gets paid.  Barack Obama makes a hell of a lot more money than I do in a year, but $400k a year is nothing compared with the combined salaries of all US citizens.
I understand that. I hope that everyone understands that 17M:2F is wrong.  newlinechar  newlinechar But you made the statement that 'in his mind he actually believes that it's not categorically wrong for an adult to have sex with a child.' newlinechar  newlinechar I too believe that, and I am not a paedophile. The devil is in the details of 'adult' and 'child', and I'm trying to engage in a debate about how we categorise people.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately, there is no consensus about this issue, so deriding someone for not seeing it in black and white is somewhat disingenuous.
Thanks for the explanation, I didn't recognize the screen and missed the joke.
You're not being an ass, you're being honest. newlinechar  newlinechar I really don't know that I'm good at mind reading, I just know I'm good at telling when other women are uncomfortable/feigning happiness. I don't know how to describe it, though I wish I could. newlinechar  newlinechar If my fiancé does something I don't like I tell him flat out that I don't like it. I'm comfortable with him and I know he's not going to go flying off the handle like a woman would. newlinechar  newlinechar I think women are so into mind games because we secretly all have an intense fear of offending other people. We think that by saying 'Oh, it's ok.' when it really isn't is going to save us trouble. It doesn't, it compounds the problems.

Man Interred. That is pretty funny. I had to say it a few times.
I don't draw parity between work done and hours worked. newlinechar  newlinechar If an employer finds offering flex-scheduling and family benefits is beneficial to them, they are more than welcome to provide those benefits.  That is what they are doing now, it just happens that providing all that unsurprisingly comes with a lower money salary. newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, were I employing people, I would do so, because it is valuable to me.  I myself have chosen to accept a salary far below my max theoretical earning potential to work in just such an environment. newlinechar  newlinechar It does not hold that this holds true for all companies or industries.  Business dealings are fluid and subjective.  Some industries, and specific companies need their employees to be more reliably available.  Extra leave and flex scheduling are not effective for them.  They purchase this increased commitment from their employees with higher salaries. newlinechar  newlinechar Once we get past simple manufacturing jobs where the input and output are clearly quantifiable, the quality and value of work is highly subjective.  The only person even remotely qualified to judge the value of that work is the person who is paying for it.
Thats what I was just coming to say. Living here in Chicago, I can attest to seeing droves of condos that were previously in the 500k+ range drop now into the mid 300's... So, home prices dropping considerably would have a major impact on this chart.

I view it as a contract.  newlinechar  newlinechar It is such a commonly created contract that has very vague rules that tend to change frequently, a class would be helpful. I also think that mandatory prenups would make divorces a lot easier and less messy.  newlinechar  newlinechar Men especially tend to enter into the contract unaware of their rights. I think that making the process more fair for all would be ideal. Mandating a prenup would make the process much more fair for all. newlinechar  newlinechar What exactly does a marriage agreement say anyway? I doubt it spells out every single thing  or spells out the rate of alimony or the rate of child support. There needs to have a clear formula to explain all this prior to marriage. newlinechar  newlinechar If the government is going to be in business of marriage at all, they need to be clear, fair and everyone involved needs to be well informed.

Yeah, that's over the top regardless of gender.  Most stereotypes really can't be applied to all women--at least in my experience.  Honestly I think it's more a cultural thing than anything else.

I think that would go far to fix a lot of these perceived problems. newlinechar  newlinechar brb, ex gf calling to whine about her boyfriend and tell me how much she misses me...oh wait

Of course 2:whateverageheis is wrong. I agree! I wholeheartedly agree. But thats not what you said. You said that 'all child-adult sex is rape'. For that to be valid, we need to investigate the understanding of adult and child. Clearly a 2 year old isnt. Clearly a 40 year old is.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to make statements that 'all &lt;activity&gt; between &lt;category A&gt; and &lt;category B&gt; is wrong' we need definitions of the categories. Or you must accept that its not always wrong within the definitions of society.  newlinechar  newlinechar I suspect you don't want to look at the theoretical because it is a very very difficult and contentious issue that doesn't fit with your black/white world view. However, its vitally important in a debate like this. I asked you a question:  newlinechar  newlinechar What magic criteria makes a person an adult, and when do we get it? newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, I find the opposite definition to pose an even harder problem: What magic criteria makes a person a child, and when and (equally-importantly) how do we lose it?

I'm expert enough in image and video compression to know that while research in the field may be more intellectually challenging than programming game AI, the latter is by far the more difficult engineering problem. When you're on the outside looking in, it's easy to think that skill in game AI boils down to knowing a few essential algorithms and when and where to apply them; in truth, that's the least of your worries. And though I've worked in the video game industry for most of my professional career, my role has never been AI programming, so this is not a case of me congratulating myself; I just respect the hell out of most of the AI programmers I've worked with, and find it condescending and ignorant to see their task described as 'not hard'.
Well then, you know what I would like to do? Come up with names for people who don't believe in different religions. For example, if you don't believe in catholicism, then we call you a catheist.

Give them a little mind fuck before they stare at me with a gaping mouth of astonishment and disbelief when I tell them I am an atheist.

No, what you would need is for the cases of it not being damaging to be greater than the cases of it being damaged. And that's just to come to the conclusion that in some cases, it's not damaging, but not in all. If you try a relationship with even one child, your chances of causing damage to an innocent child are incredibly high, and you have NO WAY of knowing if it is going to hurt them or not until they get to be an adult. Your argument is personally invested instead of being logical, and it still just looks like you are hoping to convince us that the rest of society is wrong and you are right.

So you're saying these ideologies *may* be useful in resolving some kind of challenge that may or may not arise at some point in time, so it might be detrimental to remove them from the system.  I can accept that. newlinechar  newlinechar However, in a way your statement reduces this system (our system) and these ideologies to simple mechanisms of potential usefulness, without considering their qualities and interactions with other mechanisms which I can also accept, but it bothers me. I just can't imagine, at this point in time, how they are or ever will be realistically useful, beyond some realm of mystic potential. newlinechar  newlinechar I suppose the purpose of this question was merely to fantasize what it would be like to live in a world without atheism, theism and agnosticism, but further discussion is welcomed.

Do you not know how the state of Israel was founded? newlinechar  newlinechar A bit of background for you; my father was born in Haifa, as were generations before him, going back hundreds of years.

Stories of regularly being shot at, on the way to and from school (a 12 mile walk at the age of 7)... being driven from his home by terror along with the rest of the family, almost ending up in the Gaza region but luckily made it to Nablus.

Of course, calling her 'pretty' does not automatically negate any other positive qualities she might have.

Recession hasn't hurt here as badly as in Ontario for example, we don't have an automobile industry that needs rescuing, because we don't have one, we focus our energies on products and services that will be even more useful in the future such as train and subway cars. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't think for one second that we can't make it all by ourselves: we founded this country and we sure can make Quebec work independently now, we've got what it takes, I assure you.

Keeping Einstein's famous equation in mind (energy is equivalent to matter), I often daydream about some of me eventually hurtling through space as a photon and getting to 'experience' what the universe has to offer.

Well, he is definitely exhibiting regression.  He very much believes he IS a kid, most likely because he didn't get to enjoy his 'first' childhood because he was so busy being famous, now he wants to go back and try to be who he wasn't. newlinechar  newlinechar And to be honest, a little bit of regression is healthy.  We all do it when we're sick, wanting our spouses/partners/friends to become our parents temporarily  That's fine, and there are plenty of other instances where it should just plain be more socially acceptable.   newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously, raping kids is WAY off the deep end on that, but that isn't even really regression (ie, with very few exceptions, kids don't want to rape kids).
http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php newlinechar  newlinechar It seems I was a little off (must have read a local report but 2.1 % is still about twice as much as what netapplications report. newlinechar  newlinechar I find it interresting that Net applications gets about twce as many macs an half as many linux machines as w3c counter. What I remember from last years disvussion of this is that net applications is very US centered. There is no way that mac os x gets 10% in global stats. Here is closer to 3-4% (going by anecdotal evidence) it is however very popular in the US. Likewise the US has always been behind on linux adoption

Pine cones aren't actually seeds. The seeds nestle among the 'leaves' of the pinecone.

I agree with the mind-reading thing. I think I have an explanation, too. The women I know notice *everything*. Subtle changes in posture, tone of voice, all the little signs (verbal and other wise) that indicate someone's mood/disposition/feelings. newlinechar  newlinechar For example. Kayla and I are in a room, chatting about our day with our laptops on our laps, mindlessly googling/redditing. Eye contact is easily maintained. Heather walks in and sits down and starts to join the conversation. Kayla looks at her computer screen more often, and makes less eye contact .  = Kayla finds Heather to be annoying/intrusive.  Women, am I right? newlinechar  newlinechar The men I know, on the other hand, don't recognize these changes (at least not to the same extent) and are terrible at interpreting them. It's not mind reading, its just (overly) careful observation and (at times ridiculous) amounts of interpretation.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Maybe that introversion has been caused by years of being raised as a boy.  We (at least for myself) were taught that we should deal with problems ourselves.

This is a subreddit for discussions about Christianity. newlinechar  newlinechar I have received complaints from various Christians who feel there is a disproportionate amount of trolling and other non-productive activities going on. And I have to say even as a less than active and attentive moderator, I had  feelings in a similar fashion, before I started receiving complaints. newlinechar  newlinechar However as we all know from Reddit, one man's troll is another man's guru. newlinechar  newlinechar So rather than just ban a bunch of people based on a small number of reports, I figured what we should do is have an open and honest discussion about what people are feeling and thinking about all this. newlinechar  newlinechar I founded this reddit because I am a Christian, and I don't think Christianity is incompatible with liberal morality, social justice or many other good things. Reddit is very atheist heavy, which can lead to problems for Christians. For example, when I found myself several months ago spending several hours re-batting down the whole buffet of nonsense memes, like Christianity is the equivalent of older minority cult religion X, etc. I felt it was necessary to have a place to discuss actual Christian issues on Reddit. newlinechar  newlinechar However I did not want this reddit to be all milk and honey, simply because the human implementation and practice of Christianity has created a lot of harm, as well as good. So I would rather this space be used for the honest discussion of the real problems, from whatever background anyone had on these issues. newlinechar  newlinechar If you have stumbled across me in other areas of reddit, or read my profile, you probably know my interests are much more political than religious. And I have pretty distinct perspectives in those areas. However I don't think have a perspective denies the ability of hosting and participating in honest and active discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar It's very likely there are other issues within this subreddit community I am not taking into account in this discussion, and I would appreciate it for any and all to bring them forward. But the starting place should definitely be from the reality of the complaints I have received. newlinechar  newlinechar Christianity should be challenged and questioned, however there is a point as mentioned by liquidpele, when this becomes unproductive and is motivated by activities and behaviors other than those inherent in honest discussion. Not always the case, but it definitely happens. And based on the complaints it is certainly perceived to be happening more frequently than it should. newlinechar  newlinechar So the best way to find out what is really going on is to get everyone talking to each other about it Reddit style.
class Foo: newlinechar  newlinechar def foo(self): newlinechar  newlinechar return ‘foo’ newlinechar  newlinechar aFoo = Foo() newlinechar  newlinechar aFoo.foo() newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar def bar(self): newlinechar  newlinechar return ‘bar’ newlinechar  newlinechar Foo.bar = bar newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar aFoo.bar() newlinechar  newlinechar This works, and seems a lot better to me. newlinechar You can also add @classmethod before the definition of bar to allow you to do Foo.bar() at the class level as well as the instance level if you want.

Agreed.  Seriously, one of the best things you can give your boyfriend to show how much you love him is enthusiastic sex.

Actually, it only takes 1 click on the Mac.  If you've got a Finder window open (the probability of this is pretty high if you've got a removable volume connected), there's a handy 'eject' icon right next to the name of the volume.  Otherwise, select the volume and hit ⌘-E. newlinechar  newlinechar I understand that, as the article states, this is consistent with the intended use patterns that Microsoft had when Windows 95 came out.  However, I think that today, with the context provided by pretty much *every other system tray icon ever*, they should really revise this.  The user expectation is that right-clicking the icon provides a menu, while double-left-clicking opens a window, and left-clicking does nothing.  Because of this, most Windows users I know *do* in fact take 5 clicks to 'Safely Remove' devices.  Microsoft has been more than happy to change their usability standards in cases like Office 2007, and I don't see why such a simple and obvious fix has escaped them for so long. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, one thing I have never quite understood in Windows (this dates from XP, so I'm not sure if it's been fixed in Vista): You can right-click on a disk in Explorer and select 'Eject disk,' but Windows still doesn't say that it can be safely removed (still unmounts it, though).  Never was able to figure that one out.

Well iron is a 5 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness, out of a possible 10.    newlinechar  newlinechar Where as orange is orange which is a color, so it's 1 for 1 on the scale of 'being a color', but I'm not sure where it sits on the scale of 'colorful'    newlinechar  newlinechar Merriam-Webster defines colorful as: newlinechar  newlinechar * 1: having striking colors &lt;colorful scenery&gt;     newlinechar * 2: full of variety or interest &lt;a colorful description&gt;    newlinechar  newlinechar Now, seeing as an orange only has 1 color, out of a possible 7 colors of the rainbow (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violate) that gives it a 'colorful' score of 1/7     newlinechar  newlinechar So you will see that an orange is not ten times more colorful as an iron is hard.

Not the same.

Are there any other kind?
&gt;Why are you? newlinechar  newlinechar Because there's a violation of principles and rights here. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm never going to agree that it's slavery newlinechar  newlinechar Is a person being compelled to work against their will, or face punishment if they do not? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;if you get married to someone, you agree that you're going to support that person through the relationship and afterwords if the circumstances merit spousal support. newlinechar  newlinechar You are assuming your conclusion based on the status quo. 'This is how it is, therefore how it is is right.' newlinechar  newlinechar Leaving aside whether I agree with the concept of spousal support *at all*, if it existed as a *percentage* of income, rather than a set amount, and that percentage was *equal* for both couples, then I could see it being fairer. newlinechar  newlinechar Say 33% of all income automatically goes to your spouse. One spouse lacks marketable skills and gets a job for $20k at McDonalds? They send $6666 a year to their ex. newlinechar  newlinechar The other is making $60k at a decent job? They send $20k to their lower income spouse. newlinechar  newlinechar Net result: the low-income spouse is ahead $13.3k, making $33k a year, which is very comfortable. The other takes home $46.6k, which remains large enough to act as an incentive to keep their job. newlinechar  newlinechar You're concerned about people choosing not to work as a way of getting back at their exes? They're only hurting themselves, because they  would be keeping the larger portion of their income.  newlinechar  newlinechar You gave the example of someone being supported by a new, non-spousal partner. The courts should view that as income. If they're receiving food, lodging, and expenses from their partner, but aren't employed and paying it, then their income is the value of those benefits, and they owe a portion of that to their ex. So they don't get to collect a portion of their exes income without sending any. newlinechar  newlinechar But as soon as you say 'you must pay this person $2000/month', when you've agreed to no such arrangement and are getting no benefit, the paying party absolutely becomes, as I've said, a slave. newlinechar

Indeed.  newlinechar  newlinechar So can you agree with me then that they should be used for this purpose, and only this purpose, very carefully? newlinechar  newlinechar Join me and admit that consenting sex occurs between 13, 14, 15 and 16 year olds. Lets admit that sex between a 16 and a seventeed year old is not exploitation. Lets agree that putting teenagers on the sex-offenders register for 'sexting' is just absolutely rediculous.  newlinechar  newlinechar The law needs to be there for abuse, and it needs to be very carefully wheeled out when needed. It should be applied only after a careful consideration of each case. In effect, it should be applied after a consideration of whether the sex was consenting, on a case by case basis.  newlinechar  newlinechar Its wrong when 15 year olds have sex and are prosecuted. They are victims of the law, not under it.

What the hell are you trying to say with this tired, pointless polemic?    I really, really, really want to believe this is meant to be a piece of satire. In case it is not though, you have some reactionary and downright contradictory opinions about workers rights and world affairs. In the same breath you sympathize with the plight of Jews, a historically marginalized and oppressed group, but condemn 'red necks, black people and mexicans' as 'too stupid to understand workers rights anyway'. Never mind the fact that all these groups comprise the class of workers. In your mind, they're undeserving of such basic human rights as people like you--and judging by the dominant audience demographic of Reddit--that means  a white male, age 21-27.         newlinechar      newlinechar      newlinechar As for the issue of child labor, see [the wikipedia entry on the Factory Acts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Acts) for what amounts to a historical indictment of the practice. Child labor was the lifeblood of the capitalist before labor was exported to the third world, but the end result was the same--overwork for little pay.         newlinechar 'We can't establish a world financial order if we don't have a class of people that are willing to sacrifice their dreams of contentedness to the cause of *internationalism*' This doesn't make any sense. Internationalism is the true goal of socialist revolution according to Marx. Workers the world over have more in common on the basis of social class than by arbitrary national divisions. You--for whatever reason you care to not articulate--see internationalism as necessary for the purposes of preserving the hegemony of the existing order that exploits the working class.     newlinechar In short, as a fellow worker, I wish you'd disabuse yourself of such reactionary views.

But such is the manner of temptation that the longer you resist, the stronger the urge will grow.

I guess what I'm try to say is, how can we be sure that you won't act on your inclination?  How do we know that you're not dangerous? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, you have said time and again that the reason you wouldn't act is because of the consequences for the child, but I wonder whether that is truly the case.  Do you think this would factor into it so much if you knew for certain that you could get away with it?

Yep, google it. Larry Franklin gave classified documents to AIPACers and Franklin is sitting in jail right now. But the AIPAC US citizens who transmitted the documents to Israel were not prosecuted because the judge decided that the prosecution needs to prove that the information would be used to harm the United States. And since Israel is so friendly, they would not be found guilty. So in essence the crazy people who said Israel is the 51st state were essentially correct. We have decided that this was like handing classified documents to the state of Oklahoma, so no big deal, we're all one big family. It's hard to distinguish between the American government and Israeli government at this point.

&gt; However as we all know from Reddit, one man's troll is another man's guru. newlinechar  newlinechar The key is *civil discussion*.  Many atheists here simply discuss things on a rational level in a civil way with those with whom they disagree; there's nothing wrong with that. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to find the people who ought to be banned, ask those atheists who constructively contribute to civil discussion which atheists they think are trolling, and hit them with a level 32 banhammer.  I imagine they'd suggest the same people I would: the ones whose posts constantly end up downmodded into oblivion at the bottom of the comment page because they're trying to wake up the 'sheeple' or being insulting without making any serious point.  Plus, you have the added assurance that it's not just ideological bias: the ones you ban are the ones *the leaders of their own community* rejects as trolls. newlinechar  newlinechar So, atheists who post civilly in the Christianity subreddit: who do you find yourself downmodding repeatedly? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; my interests are much more political than religious. newlinechar  newlinechar As an aside, have you ever read [The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-dott-soc_en.html)?  I'm sure it would provide interesting reading for someone who's liberally inclined politically, but conservatively inclined religiously.  In particular, I really enjoy this quotation: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;&gt; The demands of the common good are dependent on the social conditions of each historical period and are strictly connected to respect for and the integral promotion of the person and his fundamental rights. These demands concern above all the commitment to peace, the organization of the State's powers, a sound juridical system, the protection of the environment, and the provision of essential services to all, some of which are at the same time human rights: food, housing, work, education and access to culture, transportation, basic health care, the freedom of communication and expression, and the protection of religious freedom. Nor must one forget the contribution that every nation is required in duty to make towards a true worldwide cooperation for the common good of the whole of humanity and for future generations also.

I think you understand the point I'm trying to make perfectly well, so it's not necessary to have a debate about the attractiveness-or-not of female dwarves.  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as I know (granted, I've not played the game in a very long time), there is still no race in which a female character model exists that is neither portrayed as a sex object nor attached to some negative stigma or other. I mean, 'cow' is a typical insult tossed at overweight women, and fantasy culture is full of snark about female dwarves being butch, bearded, and/or lesbian. And no, there's nothing wrong with being any of those things, but I think female gamers would like to have a choice to be none of those things but also not be a sex object. newlinechar  newlinechar Is it so hard to have a female character who looks mostly like a human woman, someone girls can identify with, but who isn't dressed provocatively and doesn't have a Barbie body? Smaller breasts, a ponytail, a tunic and breeches-- would that be impossible, really? A female character doesn't have to be either asexual or oversexed.

There was an article here from an ex-child porn industry insider not to long ago. After reading it I made a comment that is somewhat relevant to your last sentence. It just amazed me to here about people telling others that they were attracted to children. That must have been hard to do.

You might say some 15 yr olds or 12 or 6 yr olds are mature? The number will always seems arbitrary because the difference between 16 and 17 seems imperceptible, especially if the younger matures faster, but the difference between a 13 and a 17 is quite noticeable. newlinechar  newlinechar I also want to ask, and I don't mean this as a slam, but I want to know if the OP may have aspergers?

There's definitely a component of traditional brainwashing. I got up and 'bore my testimony,' for the first time, at age two: no joke.  The temple experience is also classic brainwashing, for adults. newlinechar  newlinechar *But* I think most people, from the outside, fail to see the intricate, and almost entirely internally-consistent, intellectual net.  [I'm going for a really brief explanation, but it's already demanding paragraphs]. newlinechar  newlinechar There's the standard myth to explain the unknown (largely summarized in the ['book of abraham'](http://scriptures.lds.org/en/abr/contents)), which really just adds a layer between the real questions and experienced reality, like all creation myths, but it has a lot more explanatory power than genesis.   newlinechar  newlinechar Then, more importantly, the restoration myth (Joseph Smith story), which brings the modern church into the realm of the magical, invites you to think of yourself as part of a persecuted culture.  If you fully believe that, you can discount any external attack on your silly beliefs, and in fact mormons believe that they'll be rewarded for being persecuted 'for Christ.'  After 10 years I've finally forgotten the scripture, or I'd add a link. newlinechar  newlinechar The really important bit, the glue that makes this stuff stick, is what I think of as misguided-meditation.  You're told that you shouldn't take their word for what they say; you should ask God.  You're taught to do this in a very particular way: read, pray, listen.  The listening is, essentially, meditation.  You're told that you'll feel 'a burning in your bosom,' if you listen properly (quiet your mind), and that this is the 'holy ghost' indicating 'yes it's true.'  As any practitioner of meditation will tell you, this is a result of quieting your mind, not the reading and praying that came before. newlinechar  newlinechar The realization of the meditation thing was the confirmation I needed to move on with my life, but it wasn't what actually prompted me to leave.  If anyone is interested in that, I'll explain, hopefully briefly. ;)

I think you are seriously missing a huge point here, he isn't a predator. He isn't actively pursuing any kind of sexual relationship.  newlinechar  newlinechar He is even in therapy. He can't stop feeling the way he feels, and still he controls his true desires. A homosexual can't just ignore his desires and deny himself feeling that way, he can deny himself a physical relationship but he cannot deny himself his true feelings. newlinechar  newlinechar You can't seem to separate the the physical from the mental. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I see women that I would love to bed all of the time while I am walking around. Even though they are currently in a relationship. I control myself and do not attempt to court this female. newlinechar  newlinechar The motive is different, but in practice it is the same thing. Humans are unique because we have a choice in what we do. (Just not always what we think &amp; feel!). newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Once again, just because you feel a sexual attraction to a female doesn't mean you are going to force yourself onto her-even though you are capable. This is the same thing, really. If a rapist (or a child-molester which may or may not be the same thing) was out there skulking the streets actively looking for people to kidnap, then they would be predators. newlinechar  newlinechar He is not a predator, and I am sure that the great majority of these poor people are not predators as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit 2: I was also abused sexually when I was very young, and while I hold nothing but contempt for the person responsible, there is a difference between the him and the OP. newlinechar  newlinechar He made a conscious decision to act upon the urge and is entirely different than the poster of this AskReddit.

Asymptotics aside, there are no additional L1 cache misses beyond what would be required to read a stored length, so the constant factor is very small here. Well, to be precise, assuming 8-byte alignment and uniformly distributed base addresses, you'd expect an additional L1 cache miss only about (16/8)/128 = 1/64 of the time for 128-byte cache lines, rendering the average cost insignificant.

You missed my point completely. Its not that every woman gives birth and works part time but that every birthing woman must take at least some time off and their male counterpart merely chooses to do so or not. It also goes without saying that a higher percentage of women than men work part time to take care of kids.  newlinechar  newlinechar The problem occurs in assuming that any one who makes such statements is slighting women when such is not the case. Lower wages is not a penalty for being female but a simple economic indicator of a prioritization that men are often not forced to make. newlinechar

There's a difference between not understanding how something works, and being able to prove it cannot possible work.

They develop new character models periodically anyway-- I think there have been at least three scantily clad, large-breasted races added since the last time I actually played Warcraft. I really don't think it's an unreasonable thought that it might be a smart business choice to provide a character model with which young women can identify, someone they want to be because she's strong and beautiful, but not someone whose other traits take a back seat to her breasts and skimpy clothes. newlinechar  newlinechar More and more girls and women are playing video games, and it's only a matter of time until a company comes out with an MMO just as addictive and fun as WoW but with more appeal to women. Blizzard has the advantage of an existing subscriber base, and they're in perfect position to grab that emerging market before someone else does-- but if it's business as usual with them, design for the 15-40 year old male, they're essentially making a gift of that market to the first new MMO that addresses its needs.
i respectfully retract my question.  :)
well obviously there's always a risk of that, especially since unlike Java, .net is a closed system that's being reverse engineered. I would personally just use Java and not worry about it :) newlinechar  newlinechar That said, I think they've definitely done some impressive stuff on that front, from the article: newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar 'Mono's ASP.NET stack can now run precompiled ASP.NET web sites generated with Visual Studio or using the aspnet_compiler. This allows Mono to support ASP.NET applications written in languages other than C# or applications that take advantage of new VB.NET features not available on Mono's VB compiler.' newlinechar  newlinechar As far as taking a risk part goes, it is volunteer work we're talking about. People aren't doing this as a job, they do it for fun and because they want to. If somebody likes .net architecture, and wishes to spend their time porting it to linux, I say power to them. That's one of the beauties of the open source in my opinion.

I was just taught never to do anything wrong or I'd burn in Hell (or heck...I wasn't allowed to say hell).

It's not about freedom, but the skill with which children make choices. Children are less skilled to the extent that they have less experience making choices. At a certain point we recognize that they've had enough experience making choices and can take off the training wheels.  newlinechar  newlinechar If I had a ten year-old daughter, and that daughter came to me to say she wanted to date a 20 year-old man, I'd say no. She's not allowed to date a 20 year-old man, even if she says she understands sex, dating, whatever.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would also expect that 20 year-old man to have my child's interests at heart.

Not at all. It's an important thing to keep in mind when you see stories in the news reporting dog bites. newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine if people categorized Labs the way they do 'pit bulls.' You could get some pretty disturbing statistics that way, I'm sure. newlinechar  newlinechar First, call all retrievers Labs, the way people call all bull and terrier breeds 'pit bulls.' newlinechar  newlinechar Then add in all gun dogs, the way people call other breeds like mastiff and bulldog breeds 'pit bulls.' Pointers, setters, cocker spaniels, poodles. All Labs. newlinechar  newlinechar And then, include any dog that looks anything like a gun dog a Lab.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then, whenever a dog is or appears to be a mix of any of those aforementioned breeds, call that either a Lab mix (without identifying any other breeds), or better yet, just call it a Lab. newlinechar  newlinechar Eventually, when dogs bite or otherwise behave badly, victims and witnesses will start identifying them as Labs by default, thus adding to the moral panic surrounding Labs. newlinechar  newlinechar At that point, people will start getting Labs as intimidation and protection dogs, and they'll end up chained outside of their houses, unsocialized and uncared for, just waiting to contribute to the already impressive dog bite statistics for the breed. newlinechar  newlinechar Bingo. Labs are now the demon breed.
I found it funny that they listed Dalmatians in the 'less dangerous' category. Dalmatians are known to have aggressive tendencies because they were originally bred as coach dogs that ran under horses and protected against bandits.

Influenza viruses are constantly mutating, though. This isn't just gonna disappear.

Flu pandemics can be mild or nasty, but they're still flu pandemics and thus worth being somewhat concerned about.
Nah, it's not a constant thing, but it happens now and again and it's still upsetting for her when she wakes up after these types of dreams, so it has proven helpful to have a basis by which we can discuss them.  Don't tell me that my wife is the only one out there who has dreams that seem very realistic immediately after waking, regardless of how silly the premise may be.   newlinechar  newlinechar I've had dreams where I broke the law, speeding, stealing, etc, and when I wake up it is such a huge relief to realize that it was a dream (and that I'm not going to go to prison) that I can imagine what it must be like for her to process waking up from a very upsetting dream and trying to process the reality of being awake. newlinechar  newlinechar I once dreamed that my wife died.  I don't remember the details but I do remember that when I woke up I was extremely upset and depressed.  It was so realistic that the intense feelings of loss and sorrow that I felt during the dream carried over quite strongly into my waking emotions.  If that's what it's like for her when she wakes up from dreaming about me being an asshole then it's only reasonable to work through those feelings. newlinechar  newlinechar Mark

 Poodles are pretty nasty. Fuzzy containers of pure anger! :) newlinechar  newlinechar We had a Yorkie too. What a great little thing she was. I've had all the 'Scary' breeds my entire life. I still have a 10 year old Rottweiler that is a big wuss but we have a back yard so I don't ever have to deal with children or other dog owners who walk them without leashes. German Shepherds are just plain awesome and....I have to whisper this.....My personal favorites my entire life have been Akitas. I had a ultra large all white Akita with a perfectly split black mask on his face that used to freeze people in their tracks as soon as they saw him. He was never aggressive toward people but if someone brought their dog over he had the potential to get a bit rough. It always amazed me watching a large Pit, a Rottweiler and an Akita playing together in the yard when my friend would bring his Pit over. You could feel the ground shake when they knocked each other down. My Akita was tremendously powerful but man that Pit Bull would run full speed and slam into my Akita's neck and knock his ass on the ground. The ONLY dog I ever witnessed push my Akita around in fact. My last Akita lasted 14 years and 7 months. I got him the night the NY Rangers won the Stanley Cup so my girlfriend fittingly named him Bukaboom after the oversized defenseman for the Rangers. There was only one time my Akita (Bukaboom) ever had any problem with any humans. The kids next door used to taunt him with an Elmo doll over the privacy fence. I warned them and the parents knew full well what the kids were doing because they were outside a lot while this was happening. One day they dropped the Elmo doll over the fence and were attempting to retrieve it. Bukaboom grabbed it and walked just far enough out of their reach, tore it's head and arms off and slobbered all over it. He then gathered all the pieces and left it in a heaping pile of slobbery sacrifcial justice near the fence. We were all laughing and I think the kids were only traumatized mentally but never threw any other belongings into the yard again. I bought them a new Elmo and the dog got a pig's ear for offing Elmo and handling the situation like a professional. :) Also, the Akita breed also rarely barks. If you hear an Akita barking you better pay attention because it is usually something that could be a problem and not for the Akita either. I'll have another Akita again when I move out of Florida. It is just too damn hot here for that breed and I feel a lot safer with that breed than any other even though I love all large breeds to death. The only problem I may be running into is the breed selective legislation that may be happening in Nevada. I'll be moving with my Rottweiler to Las Vegas and will definitely get another dog because two are better than one in my mind. I'm sure it will take me more time to find a house in a neighborhood that is large breed friendly with a fenced in yard. I don't mind taking the extra time and spending the extra money to secure two spots for my guardians/companions. I don't own guns so they're my protection as well. I also have Kung Fu grip so that helps too! newlinechar  newlinechar I respect the power of large dogs and I've always used positive reward conditioning to keep them gentle. Actually I spoil the living hell out of any dog I own but they don't piss and moan like children if they don't get snacks lol. I have never once hit a dog I owned and it pains me to see another person hit any dog. It's true they can hurt someone without meaning to so you just have to take extra precautions to do your best to prevent that situation from occuring. Sadly there are people who don't respect or care about the animals they own or the people around them who may come in contact with them. Enjoy your dogs :) newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Holy wall of text man. Sorry! long night last night.

The Kennedy school looks like it would be way more worth it if I was over 21. It's more than $100 a night, while the Hawthorne hostel will only be $61 for a private room (I'm not a member and my girlfriend will be with me too) The hostel only has two private rooms, so there's a good chance they'll already be reserved.

Yeah, I was half joking.  It is true though that some activities are done without 'thinking' about it.

“They will suffer the consequences of their error in judgement. But, you won't.” That's just not true. Herd immunity is very real, and depends on a certain percentage of the population having immunity. If that breaks down, other people do suffer.

They suffer because of the decisions of others. newlinechar  newlinechar You can have what ever ideas you want, but when you start acting on demonstrably harmful ideas, you become a danger to society.

&gt;Why do you think this is a democrat vs republican thing? newlinechar  newlinechar It's fascinating when Republicans do something wrong, it's because they're the root of all evil. When Democrats do the same exact thing it's because 'there's no difference between the two parties'. It seems to be a common form of denial especially among Obama supporters.  newlinechar  newlinechar To answer your question, is this a democrat vs republican thing? I wasn't implying it was. It's just I rarely see a critique of Bush's policy (especially foreign and economic policy) with any acknowledgment that Obama has essentially continued and in some cases strengthened them. newlinechar  newlinechar I was just pointing that out. newlinechar  newlinechar

Actually the leaked video was a work print and was pretty unfinished. For example the last part of the movie was not done yet so all the CG was generic with notes on what to do. newlinechar  newlinechar To me it seemed a worthless download and I probably will be going to go watch it in theaters. Not a bad movie especially if you are a X-men fan.
I also want to add that vaccines are NOT a high profit margin product for pharmaceutical companies.  That's actually one of the great problems in getting them developed.  With a vaccine you need perhaps one initial dose and 2 or 3 boosters in a lifetime.  With something like an anti-colesteral or high blood pressure drug you could be taking it multiple times a day for 20 years.  It's not hard to see where the profit lies.

I'd hardly consider a quick injection an invasive procedure. I'd say most dental work is far more invasive. And just because something may provide a larger benefit, it doesn't mean that you stop something that provides a smaller, but incremental benefit. There are diseases that have all but been eradicated due to vaccines, that's a very real effect.
'we have a moral obligation to ensure the country won't collapse into civil war or severe political unrest as soon as we leave.' newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe I'm overly skeptic, but to me that sounds like euphemistic justification for continual interference in Iraq's affairs, for decades to come. newlinechar  newlinechar 'And let's be honest, we interfere in a lot of countries. Or, put another way, we promote our interests using the tools at our disposal (economic, political/diplomatic, and military).' newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, of course. And in pretty much all instances, that's a bad thing, so if you intended this as an argument for your position, it won't work for me. newlinechar  newlinechar As for the rest of your comment, it sounds to me like neo-conservatism. Nothing intrinsically bad about that of course, but I've talked to many people with neo-conservative leanings, and in the end it just comes down to personal opinion. I think interference with other countries leads to too many unintended negative consequences. They think it's worth the risks. I very strongly disagree. So let's leave it at that.
You can; this most recent comment was a gem of grammatical goodness! newlinechar  newlinechar Though, I would not necessarily call myself Christ.
I'm sorry the internet always lends itself to this sort of confusion since typing is poor medium for communication. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The article suggests there could be a renewable energy bubble. Now when I think bubble I think an irrational and inefficient investment in a sector that doesn't see enough growth or return to warrant that expenditure. I think the housing and internet bubbles are good examples. I am criticizing the idea that investing in the energy sector will create a bubble. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Many of the renewable energy projects I’ve been involved with have incredible returns. One transmission project a colleague of mine was working on had an IRR of 33%. In CA contracts are governed by the ISO and tariffs running on transmission are guaranteed. Calculating the returns on these projects is fairly easy so over speculation isn’t a big concern in the foreseeable future. Likewise CA has a Renewable Portfolio Standard that looks like it’s going to be increased to 33% by 2020. Since none of the major IOU is going to meet the 20% by 2010 requirement, they will be scrambling for new energy sources. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Unless the United States started spending ludicrous amounts of money (maybe on the order of 4% GDP) there’s no way we could over invest in the energy industry right now. We don’t have a proper national grid, we have very carbon intensive energy sources, and we have very very little storage infrastructure. I really don’t think people understand how much work there is in the energy industry.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If this article had mentioned venture capitalists over investing in emerging technology I could agree more. The ethanol bust would be a good example of how there might be a bubble of sorts when people invest in risky renewable energy sources. The example the article gave however was wind farms, which is a joke because they’re highly profitable right now while also being undercapitalized.

most likely the seedling developed in a natural pit of the tree which has filled with organic debris. usually in nature these areas are constantly damp and wood rot occurs.

They think of Atheism as a religion - which is wrong any which way you look at it. Regardless if someone wants to think that way, it _is_ wrong. Language changes, granted, but having a proper conversation requires both parties understand eachother and that requires language that both people can understand. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar At the end of the day, it boils down to a flawed understanding of what atheism is. There's nothing subjective about it (unless someone wishes to alter the definition of religion). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Side point: how does atheism represent a guiding moral philosophy? I don't see the connection.

It helps to have taken higher-level biology and/or anatomy.  Cheek bone structure, neck structure, hip structure (easy since the women are in bathing suits on commercial), etc.  If one or more appears to alter more than proportionally to the loss of bellyfat, then you're doing your body a disservice.  I have no doubt that 'fat-burning enzymes' both exist and can help you lose weight.  So does exercise.  These chemicals tell your metabolism that in order to acquire energy, it should look to fat stores instead of food ingested.  The only problem is, it's not a targeted system.  Any fat is fair game, including the protective cushioning layer in your brain and all your body's joints.  More than likely wouldn't result in serious complications except maybe later in life (premature hip replacement perhaps), but the trained eye can definitely tell who's been on a chemical diet, and who's anorexic/bulemic, or has some other eating disorder etc. newlinechar  newlinechar I've got incredibly low bodyfat content because of a screwy thyroid gland.

&gt;It is a simple DEFENSIVE move. newlinechar  newlinechar I should have just gone straight ahead with 'Altering curricula is an abuse...' newlinechar  newlinechar Granted, it is a defensive reaction rather than an explicit, intentional overstepping of bounds.  Nonetheless, ignorant behavior like this is an abuse of religion- anytime a group uses religion to insulate themselves from reality and the rest of the world, that is an abuse of religion.  I realize how many situations this definition applies to, and I can still assure you that the judgment of many religious people is no more clouded by what they hear in church than what they hear in the paper or from any other source.  They may not be a  majority, but many religious people do not abuse religion. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider how well aggressive stances like yours tend to fare.  If religious people perceive atheists as advocating the elimination of religion, then atheists will find themselves facing much more opposition than just fundamentalists.  If moderate religious people see atheists as tolerant and advocating education, compassion, and enlightenment, then who knows- we might gain a few converts.  (I am an atheist) newlinechar  newlinechar I will continue to invite people to leave rational, well educated religious people alone because there happen to be a lot of them, and they'd do more good fighting against ignorance and religious intolerance if they were on our side. newlinechar

I agree with this, but I bet that the potential for aggressive behavior can be bred too, with the result that some dogs are inherently more aggressive.  newlinechar  newlinechar Here's my logic: newlinechar Dogs have testosterone (like all mammals). newlinechar Testosterone is correlated with aggression.  Testosterone production is genetically controlled. newlinechar Thus, you can breed (intentionally or not) for greater testosterone production, which will _correlate_ with greater aggressive tendency.

The premise of e-ink, is that it will be almost identical to reading off of paper. newlinechar  newlinechar How this works currently without e-ink is that computer monitors project light at your eyes to make text. So it's like staring at a light bulb, which causes eye strain. newlinechar  newlinechar e-ink is a way of using magnetic ink to put dark spots on a lighter surface, so you read from a light source bouncing off it's surface, just like a piece of paper would work.  newlinechar  newlinechar Combine this with thin Kindle-like hardware, and you have something thinner then most books that can contain a library of information. Not only that, but you'll have the ability to hear a selection spoken, look up obscure words on the spot, read footnoted commentary on certain parts from experts or comedians, or be able to look up an exact part of the book with word search. newlinechar  newlinechar The main problem facing the e-ink industry is price, and I think they're still having trouble with full color.
They probably get more than just the tax break.  They probably have a huge say in what happens at church related events.  If they want someone to use the church for a wedding, they can probably pull the strings and make it happen.  A lot of large donations like this enable certain 'fringe-benefits'.
References like this usually make me smile, especially if they're obscure and I understand them. Arrested Development quotes are unique in that they actually make me laugh when I think of the accompanying scene.

Sounds about right. The breath-taking shots (not just in this instance) they publish are more than worth the subscription to the magazine. In fact, this one of those magazines that are worth their salt in terms of quality and content. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: PS. I'm a photographer by hobby and can only wish to get some of those shots on my own.
Let's break it down to it's simplest. First you do not chose god, God chooses you. Second it is not required for you to feel anything to be saved. It is only required that you believe that Jesus died for your sins.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you have guilt it is only because you DO NOT have a personal relationship with Christ at all and are trying to live 'religiously' without heart, or, as with most, you have not fully taken to heart that you are free from condemnation forever for your sins.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar First, nothing a person does, or does not do, sends them to heaven or hell. Eternal life is determined by only one thing - A personal relationship with Christ. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You cannot, through your feelings, conduct, words or behaviors change your position with God if you are saved. People who struggle with legalism often are trying to achieve forgiveness from God, justification before God, and acceptance by God, through obedience to God. They often end up living lives of bored religious ceremony with absolutely zero fulfillment. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The basics are this. God saw your biggest problem - sin. HE provided the remedy - his son. You had nothing to do with that. We are however present as he draws those he has chosen. Upon the moment one truly, truly is sorry for their sins and trusts in Christ for forgiveness (saved, born again) GOD DECLARES THEM RIGHTEOUS. No sin or lack of feeling or commitment can change that once it has happened. It is in essence a legal declaration by God.That is Justification. It is totally objective. You will never be more or less holy that you were at that moment. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Immediately after that however, you begin the process of sanctification, which is lifelong and highly subjective because it involves you directly. It involves your walk, every day, and it goes up and down. Sometimes you grow fast sometimes slow. Sometimes you feel strong sometimes not. It's irrelevant however to your ultimate status before God. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar From reading your posts either your church is lacking in some way or you have never really been born again. I cannot with certainty know but I can tell you that if you listen to people who boldly tell you to toss it all you will have consequences. If not in this life most certainly when it ends. I can see from your posts that your 'religious' life is highly feelings based. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Find what I would call a 'live' church. Somewhere that preaches the cross and it's impact. If you don't feel like God has any direct affect in your life then get out there and start taking God into others lives by first being around people who do and talking to them about where you are and also serving others for no other reason than for God's sake. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly I am one of those 'after-life' survivors who had many years mocking and living without GOD. My experience to you is not important but it did teach me one thing. People who tell you to quit do not know God period. They think they are so on top of everything but the fact is that God simply has not called them. Most, are not going to ever know, nor even care, that they ever know Christ. As the bible says they are marked for destruction. They are like I was, foolish, prideful, and ignorant. They have great sounding worldly wisdom. They site science, offer seemingly great joys of life without God. Freedom! No guilt! etc. The reality is though that they are in fact slaves to habits that will ultimately condemn them when they die. And both you and they will die because ultimately, as someone once said, 'death is God's limit on man's arrogance'. Once they do it will be to late. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I urge you to stay strong and continue on. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry for my rant. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Is that how Levi got you, Bristol? 
&gt;I'm assuming your business cards don't have redorkulated printed on them, so how likely is it really that someone is going to care enough to trace a comment back to you individually? newlinechar  newlinechar Heh, I would have believed that a few years ago, but the internet is getting scarier all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar But seriously, I agree with your points heartily and especially appreciate your kind words. That said, there are 2 reasons I still would rather maintain as much anonymity as I can. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Even if this conversation is one that no potential future employer, client, or colleague could find objectionable, a quick search of my reddit history will turn up a laundry list of my own personal crazy, contentious, offensive, and generally unpalatable political opinions. In my line of work the most successful people are those that keep their personal political preferences far away from their work. I pride myself with working with equal success with both sides of the aisle, and have enormous respect for many of the talented folks working diligently in both parties. I am not willing to take even the most minute chance of jeopardizing those relationships that I rely on day to day. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) This is a bit illogical, but the negative connotation of 'lobbying' has made a vicious cycle of secrecy amongst lobbyists. Because public perception is that we're about 1 step above Satan, (even Pres Obama has barred ANY registered lobbyist from appointed positions in the administration - a move that has kept countless smart, qualified, passionate individuals from getting jobs) politicians generally don't like to brag about being influenced or even cooperating with us. We're kind of Washington's dirty little secret, which is regrettable. 99% of registered lobbyists are incredibly honest, decent folks - because you typically don't last long in this business if you're perceived as a bullshit artist. But the other 1% has made us pariahs. Thanks a lot, Abramoff.
Cool, I'll hit both. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If a guy has nasty dirty shoes that look 15 years old and are not Chuck Taylors? Judged.

Shallow: *lacking depth; superficial.*  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Isn't shallow a bad thing?  newlinechar  newlinechar I think it may be useful to recognize our shallow desires for what they are.

I absolutely do not disdain academics.  After a year of working on bug fixes I was moved to a small R&amp;D team that was heavy on mathematics.  My point still stands, though.

The idea was to make a subreddit that wasn't just for original music or original writing or art, etc., but to make a subreddit where all of the content would be original but could be anything.

I just got a phone call (I average 2 phone calls a week and that is including telemarketers) and I just stared at the phone in a complete panic...What am I supposed to say to this person? How will it affect the world as I know it? Will I once again unwittingly cancel my favorite show? Am I about to start the chain reaction that ends the world? Timidly I picked up the phone fearful of what horror I was about to unleash on my nice cozy life...just to find out it was my father asking if I had a set of rabbit ears that he could have, foolishly I said yes (thinking I knew exactly where they were) well it looks like this weekend I get to go through all the random bits of electronic hardware I have accumulated over the years.

The thing is that AP pays professional reporters to go out and get the news.  Without some way of financing professional news services, news, as bad as it already is while controlled by such a small oligarchy, will devolve into indymedia, which, though useful to a degree, is basically rumor circulated by amateurs without the standards needed for story verification, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm all for a new, more democratically-based professional quality news media.

Having a discussion about quality is one thing.  Sure you can call a spade a spade and say that Battlefield Earth is probably not as good as Star Wars.  But dismissing the dozens of reasons why any show can succeed or fail down to 'the problem is that it was too smart and too intricate for your average tv viewer.'  Is the definition of self-righteousness.   newlinechar  newlinechar I liked Arrested Development a ton but I always understood why people wouldn't like it and that didn't have anything to do with me being smarter.  It had more to do with my having tons of free time that I could clear a hole to watch a TV show every week and go back and watch old episodes if I was missing something. newlinechar  newlinechar For my money 30 Rock holds a lot more pleasure than AD did.

I'm not talking about being pinned or cornered somewhere.  Unless you are in the middle of absolute nowhere, chances are you will run into packs of roaming zombies at some point along your travels.  Then you have to either get around them or through them depending how large the group is, and how scattered they are.  And if you're stationed somewhere, then they are likely going to come across you.  And unless this is a huge quarantine zone, or very well fortified outpost, it won't be permanent.  You'll need to deal with the numbers at some point.
&gt;I know he comes on tv and claims that government take overs of these corporations is not what he wants but I simply don't believe him. Especially considering how quick his administration has acted to gobble up any company they deem 'too big to fail'. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I was going to add that to my original comment, but thought I'd leave it on the table.  I happen to agree with you on this. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It is curious that his other option, doing nothing, would've been ridiculued as being terribly irresponsible and an attack on the employed of America.  I imagine that his blue-collar, union base would rapidly dissolve and the talking heads would've raked him over the coals. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If he didn't fully become invested into these companies, he would've been accused of doing to little.  I realize this is all speculation, but I don't think any solution is superior to the others. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It's an all out assault against the private sector. The market has completely frozen because nobody knows what's Obama is going to do next. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That's a big piece of the puzzle to be sure.  The economy is also stagnating because consumers are pouring money into debt repayment instead of consumption.  Once the debt is repayed, price increases will skyrocket and the economy will expand..

I think it's fine to joke about pretty much anything - what's not fine is to dismiss the literary merit of a book out of context, and simply because you *don't like the author*.  newlinechar  newlinechar The author's moral credibility has very little to do with his work. Many of the classical works you seem to be all art-snobby about were written by drunken misogynists. newlinechar  newlinechar Everyone IS entitled to their own aesthetic opinion, you just have an insufferable air of superiority about the entire affair.
Why not cut out the middle man and just send all SU traffic straight to a non-profit of your choice's website?

No, I have ID.  I also have genitals.  I see no reason to show either one to the TSA, because (a) they have no legal right to demand to see them, barring extraordinary circumstances, and (b) in no way do either of these things relate in any way to their job, i.e., determining if I'm a physical threat to the aircraft or its passengers. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, apparently I have the same name as somebody else on a secret 'no-fly' list.  But if they can clear me to fly, despite my name, by inspecting me physically, then they didn't need to know my name in the first place.

&gt;well obviously there's always a risk of that, especially since unlike Java, .net is a closed system that's being reverse engineered. newlinechar  newlinechar Not true.

Ann, imagine something for me, okay? newlinechar  newlinechar You attend a private males-only religious high school in the United States. Nearby is a private females-only religious high school. The two are sister institutions, and dances are frequently held for both schools in the same location so the boys and girls can dance together. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, some of the older students from the girls' school have started holding parties when their parents are out of town. Parties with only one gender are no fun, so they invite boys from your school-- except that as they plan these parties, the girls are also playing a dangerous game. They've bet one another that they can out-drink some of the younger boys who have been invited, and trick them into performing sex acts with the older girls in front of their friends. The girls know that they will not get in trouble for it, because they're preying on young men from religious households who would be in just as much trouble for drinking and having sex as the girls would be for providing the alcohol and manipulating them sexually. newlinechar  newlinechar So let's say you get invited to one of these parties and a 'nice' girl keeps offering you drinks, and then she rapes you with her girlfriends' encouragement, and earns 20 points in the 'game' for doing so. She also snaps a polaroid photo while in the act, so that if you threaten to tell someone what she did, she can threaten to send it to your parents. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, this girl might simply be an evil sexual predator, and she is definitely deeply disturbed. But would she have committed rape without a group of like-minded friends making a game of it? If she didn't know that her behavior would result in earning the admiration of her friends, winning a game, receiving congratulations, and no negative consequences whatsoever, would she have done it? Was she not motivated in part by a clearly defined rape culture? newlinechar  newlinechar If you're wondering where I got this example, something similar happened at a high school in my area while I was in middle school. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, I agree that 'rape culture' has become such an overused term that it has about as much meaning in most circumstances as 'flying purple people eater culture' would.

For long exposure shots, I found that a VERY stable tripod is essential. For work on dirt, I would use one of these giant screws that they sell at pet supply places to anchor a dog leash.

This would pull the tripod down and make it very steady.  newlinechar  newlinechar For areas that I was working on a hard surface, I would carry along an empty 1 gal milk jug and fill it with sand, dirt or water from the area and hang it from the tripod to make it more steady.

really?  not to be snarky, but: how do you know this?  my parents are doctors and have an understanding of publication bias, metaanalytic methods, etc that impresses me given their training is primarily applied (not research-based like mine).  in addition, 2 references for a metaanalysis is just completely ridiculous.  i couldnt' tell you how many references are analyzed in some of the most useful metaanalyses I've read, but I could certainly tell you there were more than 2 refs!

Doctors do not live in bubbles.  They realize people cannot pay for health treatment or care, so they do whatever they can to not waste patients' time and money.  At least, decent ones do. Genius up there didn't bother to talk to the two doctors available via his HMO and insist on being tested, or even ask if there were any symptoms he should be on the lookout for in the future.

You're using the wrong gauge to judge our opinions.

Actually, that's not the right answer.

You're right, there is a lot more to socialism than reading Marx. But you it's awfully hard to have a good counterpoint to capitalism without understanding basic Marxist precepts. I actually recommended using a reader, as I have found that students take poorly to picking up the original text. It was my hope that suggesting a reader would help contextualize Marxist thought in a more accessible way, so as to prevent misinterpretation (which tends to make people think that 'Marx is full of shit'). OP, if you'd like me to suggest some resources for understanding Marx, I will happily do so.  newlinechar  newlinechar Let's not play games of taxonomy here. Yes, there are many reasons why one would want to draw a line between the Chicago School and libertarian ideology. But open a newspaper and find an instance where that distinction would be relevant. When it comes to macroeconomic policy, the libertarian academy lines up almost squarely with Friedman and his intellectual progeny. If you want to be well-versed in the practical aspects of heterodox economics, you'll need to understand the different macroeconomic theories. If you want to sit around and navel gaze about an entirely practical discipline, skip Keynes.  newlinechar  newlinechar In my humble opinion, the Rawls/Nozick debate is entirely relevant. Libertarianism and any other sort of distributive justice scheme fundamentally clash around conceptions of rights and liberties, which is the Rawls/Nozick debate. While I'm not suggesting that every socialist and every libertarian should have an understanding of what the issues of that debate are, I am calling bullshit on the notion that either author is 'totally irrelevant to this thread'.

I've never been married, but I did a project/presentation on polyamory (not an expert in any way, grain of salt, etc...). If your significant other enjoyed something you didn't, would you object to them finding other people to do it with? For instance, if they enjoyed walking outdoors - would you object to them joining a walking group? newlinechar  newlinechar Sex is not walking, and a polyamorous relationship does need rules and boundaries and trust. But if she's willing to let you satisfy your needs, it may actually make your relationship stronger by focusing not on the things she doesn't offer you (sex), but the things she does. Assuming that your relationship is strong; if it's not, then you have bigger things to worry about. newlinechar  newlinechar I would definitely sit down with her and figure out where she's coming from and why she feels the need to offer this now.

I will give it a shot with some bullet points.  I didn't watch all the videos... but think I heard enough: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Buying up the bonds of a spending country by a saving country protects the currency of the saving country.  China keeps the cost of its products low by buying US bonds.   newlinechar  newlinechar 2. The US has a HUGE discretionary overhead that it can reduce substantially: military expenditures.  To do this, it has to turn over military security to other nations.  Obama may be hinting at this with his 'treat Europeans as equals.'   newlinechar  newlinechar 3. The regulations that will help prevent currency manipulations discussed above are in the works.  I think the US has a great deal of influence in establishing the regulations.  So, part of the regulation may be in preventing China (aside from their need increase in the strength of their currency) from 'dumping' US bonds. newlinechar  newlinechar 4. Obama seems to acknowledge the competition with China will ultimately result in a 'better' US.  Perhaps this is a hint at his belief that once China's currency is traded at its real value, the US will have no trouble selling products in China. newlinechar  newlinechar 5. Inflation in the US always reduces the cost of the outstanding debt.  I am not sure about this, but in theory China not purchasing US debt may drive up bond yields which could in turn drive up inflation.   newlinechar  newlinechar 6. China plans to reign in their US bond purchases but are constrained by the above.  Also, their purchases of commodities have driven up their prices which affects the prices of their products - although this would presumably affect the prices of all products in the world. newlinechar

People would call and say they were mischarged, the manager would send them a gift certificate, and that was that.  newlinechar  newlinechar One waitress actually did lose her job over an identical situation. It was Memorial day, the restaurant was full, and there were only 2 servers on. The one server (who had 11 tables at the time) overcharged the patron by $4, and the patron called absolutely furious when he received his credit card bill. He demanded that the waitress be fired. She even offered to pay for his entire bill out of her pocket ($40 something).  newlinechar  newlinechar She called me (a supervisor) crying. I was so disgusted at the situation that I walked out.

So in other words, to raise my child as you see fit? Fuck that.  newlinechar  newlinechar The state has a right to interfere with the parent when the parent is endangering one of its citizens - the child - and nothing more. This isn't any more state influence in family matters - or rather, there should not be - then there is  over your right to live free of my interference.  newlinechar  newlinechar Moreover, the right to religion - including all associated beliefs - is enshrined explicitly in the Charter. If you are trying to suggest that instilling a certain religious viewpoint is somehow child abuse and warrants state intervention you have a bit of an uphill battle.  newlinechar  newlinechar You should also take heed that atheism is not in the majority in this country. Losing the right to express your own religion is bound to affect those of us that *do* want evolution taught much more dramatically that those that *don't*.  newlinechar  newlinechar  
Crap, I'm making my own thread here...  Oh well.  newlinechar  newlinechar You mention Jesus saying that God will 'move mountains and answer their prayers,' please don't take that at face value. There is a whole wealth of context behind those statements, and I don't think it is appropriate to take them literally.  newlinechar  newlinechar Moving on, 'Since you point out that the Bible is old and we have embarrassingly out-of-date copies subject to alteration and distortion, should we believe one word of it? If Genesis is not verifiable and therefor not trustworthy, and it provides the entire case for creation, on what basis can we believe in creation? My apologies if you do not believe in theistic creation.' newlinechar  newlinechar The field of Textual Criticism tackles how valid and how confident we can be in our copies. Surprisingly, the NT can and should be trusted. i.e., the version of Koine Greek that we have is likely 99%+ accurate to the original (Bart Ehrman, and a select few are more pessimistic, but the scholarly consensus is 99%+). I can go more into depth with this later.  newlinechar  newlinechar The OT is a whole different boat. Our earliest transcripts come from 900 AD (the Masoretic Text - MT), and from the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). Surprisingly (again), there are minimal differences between the MT and the DSS. The DSS belonged to a very strict sect of Judaism around the time of Christ, so a 900 year difference between them and the MT. With few differences. Furthermore, we have the Septuagint (LXX), which is a Greek translation of the OT originating around 200 BC. So between these three, we possess the entire OT. The problem is, Genesis was likely compiled from a few different authors 1000-2000 years *before the LXX*. So yeah, there are some concerns. Can we trust it? Well, that is a modernist lens talking. Likely, the author of Genesis never meant his composition to be viewed through out enlightened, modernist perspective. He is just making some theological points and providing a creation narrative. We need to view it through that lens. I would say no, don't take it to the bank. But it's theological points and the message it conveys might be a different story. Some people can make a logical argument to trust in *that*, but there is always a leap of faith.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 
Thanks for your message. It is, of course, completely true that it's remarkably easy to find out someone online - I'd never done it before, but was able to find so much about him in the space of 5-10 minutes. But with regards to using your own name as your handle - if your name is fairly uncommon, perhaps it is not so wise to use it - after all, with a generic handle, it is far more easy to throw doubt onto any information someone may find on you.

I know it's bad form to reply to one's own post, but I would like to keep the summary separate from implementation details, suggestions, etc.  Let me elaborate a bit on what I'm thinking here. newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of CS majors are 'overeducated', in the sense that their day job requires a tiny fraction of the knowledge and skills that they have collected.  Hobby projects are often a fun way to actually use this, however the most interesting ones seem to be very time consuming to set up.  Reducing time/effort/knowledge barriers to make non-professional exploration of the boundaries of CS might allow more individuals to become involved, and increase the satisfaction associated with it in the process. newlinechar  newlinechar I would like to be able to log onto this site, find interesting problems (or solutions looking for a problem!), chat about them, etc.  If an idea strikes, I should be able to download a 'problem set' from the site and quickly start hacking on a potential solution.  It should be easy for me to share my partial/final solutions with everyone to be discussed, rated, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar What could the problem sets contain to facilitate this?  As I see it, the most important thing is 'batteries included' - minimal effort required on the part of the participant other than writing the algorithm itself.  Some things the problem set might have: newlinechar  newlinechar * Description of the problem, including comments, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar * Data sets related to the problem. newlinechar  newlinechar * Test harness, useful libraries, etc for the problem in whatever languages the community wishes. newlinechar  newlinechar * Reference implementation (be faster/better/more robust than this) newlinechar  newlinechar * Standardized graphical/textual 'results' that can be submitted to the website. newlinechar  newlinechar * Generic parameter tuner. newlinechar  newlinechar * Other participant's solutions. newlinechar  newlinechar * Publically available papers in the field. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a lot of diversity in the 'computer geek' crowd - some individuals would just want to chat about potential algorithms, others just want something to code for the evening.  Yet more love the idea of taking a working solution and tweaking it to be even better.  Combining the resources of these differing individuals should, in theory, allow us to create better solutions for things. newlinechar  newlinechar If we're to make a site like this, of course we should try to use as much software as is already available - I'm thinking that something like apt or portage might make sense, though git/mercurial/svn may be useful for various things as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The most important thing, at least to me, would be to get a core set of interesting problems up and to start working on solving them.  Aggregating additional problems after that step should be much easier.  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  I really do need to learn markdown

*The very idea that marriage should be a complex legal affair, off which lawyers and courts can make a bundle before and after, is itself wrong.* newlinechar  newlinechar I am genuinely curious: what do you think marriage *should* be, if not a voluntary set of mutual rights and obligations to which the parties involved agree to be bound? newlinechar  newlinechar It becomes a complex legal affair for the same reasons most laws do: they involve people, who are notoriously good at looking for loopholes and defining what 'is' is in a way that is helpful to them. Add to this that people in the throes of ending a serious relationship are rarely on their best behavior. newlinechar  newlinechar *You're being evasive.* newlinechar  newlinechar Have you stopped beating your wife? Ah, ah, no trying to answer with anything but a yes or no, unless you wish to be called *evasive*, sir. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not an easy question to answer and there's no simple answer, like 'you have to take the high paying job' vs. 'take any job you want for any reason'. We don't want to reward the person who says 'screw you, I'm quitting my job, get blood from a stone'. We also don't want to punish the person who wants to be an artist but *could* be a corporate lawyer, because, y'know, he has a law degree. My understanding as to how most states handle this is that the complaining spouse must show that person is deliberately underemployed; there's not a requirement that they take the highest-paying job available. But if somebody was a happy corporate lawyer until the day after the support order, when she suddenly discovered she wanted to be a street preacher, isn't that a little suspicious? newlinechar  newlinechar Support does not raise the level of obligation, at least in a community-property state. 'Joint economic enterprise' means that everything is shared. My paycheck is not mine; it's ours. My 401(k) is not mine; it's ours. (Yes, even after a divorce, because I earned it during the marriage.) Spousal support is, or at least ought to be, minimal and temporary aid to a displaced spouse whose income took a significant hit as a result of the divorce. If we're both corporate lawyers, neither of us should get support. But if my husband gave up his lucrative career to stay home and raise the kids while I worked, free of daycare worries, it's a little disingenous of me to say 'Get a job, bozo, and hands off my money!' newlinechar  newlinechar *Should spousal support be based on someone's real income, or on what they could hypothetically make, regardless of what they actually want to do?* newlinechar  newlinechar Income is not frozen in time. That's why we allow support modifications. Again, if I've got a law degree from Yale but I've spent the last ten years as a glassblower, it's silly to say that, hypothetically, I should make a lawyer's salary. But it's also silly to say that if I have a sudden midlife desire to be a cigarette girl at a bar, that should immediately trump any of my other obligations. newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, surely you wouldn't argue that all those arguments about debt slavery and my Right Livelihood apply equally to my obligations to support my kids, right? So the issue isn't any of those things. Either postmarital support is okay or it's not.

Are you kidding me? newlinechar  newlinechar Guy's son is a crook. 32 counts. 32 separate criminal offenses!  newlinechar  newlinechar The role of a father is to help your child make the *right* choices, not aide his errors. Yes, that is emotionally tough sometimes.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, I'm critical of his parenting skills, as I would be of any parent that helps their child break the law to *avoid punishment that they agreed to enforce*.  newlinechar  newlinechar While he doesn't deserve anywhere close to 14 years in jail, he does deserve punishment. 
Well, I suppose. Especially being a teen. Sorry for the mis-step.

Interesting.  'Just sit and look pretty'.  'That's no way for a lady to talk'.   newlinechar  newlinechar I can see how that makes sense.
&gt;you don't enter into other kinds of legal relationships and then plead ignorance after the fact and expect it to be an excuse newlinechar  newlinechar Again, this is the lawyeristic way of looking at things. newlinechar  newlinechar Most people don't consider marriage as a complex legal affair. And don't believe it should be one. They simply want to declare their relationship with the person they love. It's lawyers and governments who have intruded on it and attached the complex existing regime, *ostensibly* with the purpose of doing good, but clearly in such a way that ends of violating a person's rights. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I also don't like seeing destitute families either. newlinechar  newlinechar If there *are* destitute people, then shouldn't we, as a nation, support them together, rather than forcing people to work against their will? newlinechar  newlinechar

I object!
Thanks for writing such a detailed response; hope you enjoy your evening! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; My perspective is that when you enter into a marriage, you agree that the assets are becoming pooled. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that is how it *should* be, but I think current divorce law (at least in the US, can't speak for Canada) makes this untenable. Marriage used to be for life (in theory), so it would make sense to pool all your assets. Now that it's not, well, I guess that's just why we have pre-nups. I agree, in theory, though. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As for the rest of your post, I agree with this, in situations where she's been out of the work-force, or put him through school, and similar things. That might be about the only times alimony is paid, and if so, I support it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Where I might qualify it is, for example, in the case of that woman claiming expenses of 50k a week in divorcing her husband, *beyond* child support. Not just because of the amount, but for the following reasons, that I think could also be applied to less extreme cases: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar a) He brought lots of money *into* the marriage. They didn't build it together, with her managing the household while he worked. She just brought her good looks/personality, whatever he married her for. She is taking her part away, so I don't see why she should be entitled to keep his part. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar b) During the marriage, she's undoubtedly been not working by *choice*, had a maid and nanny, and led a life of leisure or at least self-interested pursuit of pet causes/hobbies. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar c) I forgot what my third point was. I can very much see the value of alimony when one spouse supports the other by working at home. I can't see it in many other situations. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar d) I'm always in favor of child support, regardless of the circumstances (excepting paternity fraud and the like). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar tl;dr I'm for men 'reimbursing' women for the investment they made into a marriage relationship; I'm against women divorcing a man and being *entitled* to his future earnings (to me that seems slave-ish) *if she has not made those sorts of contributions*.

Poe's law in action.
Really? My thought was that his wife is probably just like him kinda old and fat and hates sex, but doesn't want to be alone and doesn't want to leave the financial comfort of the relationship. Overall this guy sounds like a douche though. I mean, no car? He's expecting alot for what he seems to be offering, which is nothing really. Except sex, which a chick can pretty much get anywhere anyway, so really nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar 
&gt;and bulldoze there houses newlinechar  newlinechar You bulldoze *their* houses. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, *homes* would have been more appropriate, since it's more than just their physical property you're destroying, you're truly destroying their *homes*.
Hahaha, yes, oh sweet irony.  newlinechar  newlinechar Like I mentioned as well, we pretty much tend to know what the solution is to the problem. We just need to vent. I can't explain it other than the fact that the emotions become really physical and you need to get rid of them, so you have to vent them out and you think that your partner is the perfect person to listen and understand. newlinechar  newlinechar Instead of assuming you need to fix something, assume she is venting. You'll get in less trouble.
Your parents don't have control over your afterlife.  That makes people very afraid and emotional to their beliefs.  People reeeeeally don't want to go to hell-and have been shown time and time again to be easily mislead with supernatural nonsense. newlinechar  newlinechar Nationalism, forced communism, racism and other ideologies can only turn people so far from their normal selves.  Religion is the best tool to enslave a society and make them do horrible things they wouldn't normally do.
Actually, the usual idiom for 'world peace' in Russian would be 'mir vo vsem mire'(мир во всем мире) which literaly means 'peace in the entire world'. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think 'mirovoi mir' is ever used like you said, probably because there is a more usual meaning for 'mirovoi' - it means 'common, universal'. newlinechar  newlinechar 
See, this is a perfect example. newlinechar  newlinechar A relatively simple matter: voluntary cohabitation, is turned into a legal minefield, where people are obligated far beyond anything they willingly and knowingly consent to, because lawyers and the government are intruding far beyond where they have any business. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not a libertarian. I'm a leftist. But damn if I can't see their point sometimes. newlinechar

It seems to me that, in practice, the system is biased against men. Someone could say that's fair enough, because it's been biased against women since forever ago, but I think we need to try to balance it correctly. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I am *certain* that my wife is a better nurturer than I could be with our son; perhaps there are other than biological causes to that (socialization or just being a better person overall) but the ones I can think of don't seem plausible to me. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Patriarchy is a big word, and depending on what meanings you have for it, I may agree with you, or I might violently disagree.

Hey, I'm not an American and I wasn't speaking about the correct terminology in English. I was issued an AKM when I was in one of the Pact of Warsaw armies long time ago and it was named 'pistol'. Still is. The other thingy in your link is an automatic rifle, not a machine gun.  newlinechar  newlinechar For us, anything small caliber/short cartridge *is not* a machine gun, they are what I wrote above.  newlinechar  newlinechar So, in here compared to the US: newlinechar  newlinechar pistol = pistol or hand gun, automatic pistol = all submachine guns and assault riles, automatic rifles = LMG, LMG = automatic, using the full power cartridge (7.62x54).

I have read almost everything Rand wrote, including the nonfiction, and while she had some nuggets of truth, she also had some loony ideas.  newlinechar  newlinechar And you completely distorted my point, perhaps deliberately. I said: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;[Rand] couldn't get that people are **both**, and that warped all her thinking. newlinechar  newlinechar Emphasis added for your benefit. Rand was wrong, utterly. Of course people can be both selfish and selfless.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Every uncoerced action we take is to put ourselves into a better state than would exist if we did not act at all. This is an irrefutable axiom. newlinechar  newlinechar Ah, the irrefutable axiom, so beloved by Randians, Austrians, and other fundamentalists. It should be obvious that many people do things that do *not* put themselves into a better state. Many purchases, drugs, obviously bad relationship choices.... You evade this by saying that all actions 'better the individual in some way,' but include gaining 'some smidgen of content feelings.'

Edit: apparently not, student loans are broken law too, as is post-secondary funding in the US. Europe uber alles.

Both, one, or neither spouses can work. It's their option.  newlinechar  newlinechar AFTER the marriage, according to your view, the spouse that WAS working *is now forced to*, while for the other, it's optional. newlinechar  newlinechar How is it conscionable that divorce imposes greater obligations than the marriage itself? newlinechar  newlinechar Edit2: another difference between student loans and spousal support, is that student loan companies are businesses that make profits by investing funds in the education of young people, that they expect to profit from by charging interest. They also anticipate a portion of defaults and delinquency that they account for. newlinechar  newlinechar Fannie Mae isn't facing starvation or homelessness if you become an artist, and if you take a career that a $100k loan pays for, then you'll likely be able to afford to pay it: meaning you're continuing to enjoy the benefits of the original loan (your education and high income), so you are maintaining the mutually beneficial relationship. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The fact that I may or may not have gotten something from that loan is irrelevant to your argument newlinechar  newlinechar No it's not. Marriage is not a fee for service, nor a loan. It's an ongoing mutual exchange *for the duration of the marriage.* When the marriage ends, then there should be no further obligation for mutual support. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit3: If this were Dickensian London in the 19th Century, I would absolutely sympathize with the view that because there's all these old misers tossing their helpless wives out into the gutters to be preyed upon by scoundrels, that the courts must intervene for their protection. newlinechar  newlinechar But this isn't the 19th century, and women are not helpless waifs, defenseless against the world without someone to constantly provide for them. And neither are men.  newlinechar  newlinechar If a divorced spouse has the means and opportunity to provide for themselves, then it's up to them to do so, rather than expecting to be provided for as if they were still married. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The courts, as I understand it, do not simply look at what you might be able to earn, but at your past employment history and current economic circumstances. newlinechar  newlinechar So if the alimony-receiving spouse COULD work, but chooses not to, they can keep receiving alimony; but if the alimony-paying spouse chooses not to, they face prison. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;that married people get rights and responsibilities? newlinechar  newlinechar Is any contract that violates the rights of a party enforceable? newlinechar  newlinechar

Possibly bad wording on my part.  I don't mean that people shouldn't change their minds.  I mean that when someone puts forward a claim, they ought to be willing to stake something (money, reputation, etc.) on it at the time they make the claim.  Otherwise, we get a situation where pundits, etc. just say whatever they want, the more outrageous the better, because there are no consequences for being wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar Even 'staking something on it' isn't quite the phrasing I'm looking for.

Well, i, at least easily got used to it. Also, usually you have to do a lot of stuff that is not basic addition. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, lisp can do this in a macro, but that requires one to call the macro and keep whitespace around it. newlinechar  newlinechar I did make a reader macro that can do it without those disadvantages; everything between \[ \] gets treatment with your binary-notated functions.(And you can manipulate the precidence, add other binary functions too.) I was messing with reader macros and silly other stuff like that. [unlisp](http://lisp-umac.berlios.de/unlisp.html) It is stuff i wouldn't use, so it isn't really tested much. (And reader macros don't get caught by the autodocumentation, the one i used is also rather rudementary.) newlinechar  newlinechar Disadvantages of reader macros(macro characters) are that they can collide with other reader macros, and any variables and functions that have those characters.(\] and \[ dont seem oft-used though) But you can disable/enable them as needed and no sane dev will force the external user to use reader macros. If you want and think people would use it, i can improve better test the unlisp thing.
i was wondering if someone would catch on. well done.

I'm with Beriadan. The blog post says users are doing it wrong. In my opinion, those few notification icons use a unique interface design, which throws off everyone who is used to right-clicking a file icon for operations on it. So the interface is inconsistent, not the users. newlinechar  newlinechar Another problem users have with the notification icon is double clicking (maybe pre-XP, I haven't tried lately), which brings up the expert mode. Because you have to double click a file icon to get it to do anything, some users do the same thing with the notification icons. I had to tell one user about 4 times to single-click the icon, which he would promptly double click out of habit.
I'm afraid that my answer was not nearly as good as your question.  Wikipedia provides overviews of these problems, but little about the categories of these problems for which specific solutions are being sought. newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, when I was in grad school, I did a research project on ensemble classifiers using a modified bayes' rule, so as to not reduce the diversity of the ensemble.  The effectiveness of this method, as well as the optimal parameter tuning, was heavily dependent on the data set (and pre-trained classifier set) being used.  These problems are not difficult to understand, and indeed it is not a huge secret that they exist, however Wikipedia doesn't give a would-be experimenter much more than an encyclopedic overview and a few good links, nor should it. newlinechar  newlinechar This site, as I see it, would be a combination social coding/experimentation site, along with all of the necessary things to bootstrap experimentation.  Also, the site would be focused less on providing a reference about a problem, and more towards providing potential solutions or components of solutions.  I fully expect that Wikipedia would be referenced and/or excerpted on the site. newlinechar  newlinechar For a few more specific examples: newlinechar * Image segmentation for the detection of design flaws in a factory setting.  Very data set dependent. newlinechar * Human-in-the-loop guided evolutionary solutions to engineering problems, via orthogonal decomposition of solution vectors and human-intelligent recombination (the EA clusters related traits to find useful 'components' which a human might suggest certain combinations of as a starting point for optimization/tuning) newlinechar * Texture synthesis detection - find the fake! newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, there's plenty of problems with 'simple' solutions that have yet to be found - we need more eyes and a lower barrier to entry. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I should mention that when I say 'experts', what I really mean is 'people who work in a specialty of a field, or an adjoining area, as opposed to a person with a more generic concept of computer science'.  So maybe that's why I'm not making a lot of sense here.

I have the feeling a lot of misinformation is floating around in your idea of the early christian environment. I'll try to keep this short and simple.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Nicea is where the NT canon was generally formed. They had to come to a consensus about which books should be trusted and which should be banned due to theological debates, chiefly regarding Jesus' identity (fully god? Fully man? both?). We do know a lot about some of the books that were not selected. Others we know just by name, because we no longer have copies of those books. Most were pseudepigraphal, lit. 'false writings.' People would have something to say about the church or some theological point, and they would write it in the style and manner of someone who did have authority (like Paul, or Peter), in order to give their ideas credibility. Other things, similar to this happened. Overall, the NT canon was formed in defense of 'heretical' doctrines sprouting up. You might enjoy Bart Ehrman's book: Lost scriptures. He does a good job detailing these books and explaining why they were not included.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Paul, and the later NT books do have credibility because there were not that far removed from Christ. Paul especially, since he was such a prominent figure in the early church. It is a misconception to think that legend can accrue in 20-50 years. It really takes much longer than that - ESPECIALLY in an orally dominant culture and with the presence of eyewitnesses to retard any myths that might accrue.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Jesus is a historical figure, that much we are certain. There are independent, external witnesses that testify to this fact. The Jews talk about him in their Rabbinical writings, Josephus mentions him (although yes, Christians later *added* to Josephus' remarks, making him out to be divine). So the debate does not surround whether or not Jesus existed, but more to do with *who* Jesus was, what was his message, and how did his life end?

Demon possessed =/= mentally ill in those verses. You have only cited verses where Jesus drove out demons. newlinechar  newlinechar There is absolutely *no* mention of any possible mental illnesses in *any* of those verses,. newlinechar  newlinechar Why did you only proved links? Why didn't you actually copy/paste any of those links? newlinechar  newlinechar Here, let me do your work for you: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him everyone who was sick-those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed-and he healed them. newlinechar  newlinechar So Jesus healed the demon-possessed. Absolutely no mention of anything that can be said to be symptoms or any indication of mental illness. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gerasenes, two demon-possessed men met him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could travel on that road. newlinechar  newlinechar Here we have a single indication of what *could* be the symptom of a mental illness. But, you can't diagnose *anything* with such a vague description as 'violent.' Maybe the demons were making the men play hockey and they were body checking people off the road? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;As the men were going out, a man who couldn't talk because he was demon-possessed was brought to him. newlinechar  newlinechar Here we have another vague description that could possibly maybe be taken as a symptom of mental illness. However, without a more complete description of what state this guy was in there is really no way to know. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Jesus was driving a demon out of a man who was unable to talk. When the demon had gone out, the man began to speak, and the crowds were amazed. newlinechar  newlinechar Same as last time. newlinechar  newlinechar Let me check my DSMIV to see if these are symptoms of mental illnesses. Oh wait, there isn't enough to even go on. newlinechar  newlinechar Have you also considered the possibility that Jesus was simply *healing possible mental illnesses in these verses*? Medicine was in a primitive state 2000 years ago in Judea, and *psychology* did not exist until no earlier than 150 years ago. The psychological phenomena that people then may have labelled 'demon possession' may have been something they simply didn't assign scientific explanation to. newlinechar  newlinechar But of course I'm getting downvoted for simply asking for citation while your bullshit Google search for 'Jesus, demons, possessed' is getting upvoted. newlinechar

Crazy biology student theory: newlinechar  newlinechar Women seem to only be physically attracted to men on a part-time basis. The unconscious primate mind is constantly evaluating men for other standards of fitness. Part of it is gleaned from the perception of other men and women. newlinechar  newlinechar Hence, some women have a need for men to at least have the opportunity to philander. Some women actually have an unspoken requirement for their partner to be promiscuous. In some relationships, it is possible to have sex with many women, provided each (or the) persistent partner believes that your provider relationship is exclusively focused on them. newlinechar  newlinechar Nature doesn't care about 'fair.' Most primates are promiscuous, and depending on the species that can mean either gender or both. We all have over-sized sex organs for a reason. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you both work?

Partnering past breeding age is an anomaly in biological history.  There's no playbook in nature's handbag once your offspring have grown beyond their immediate need of you, which is about eight years, and right about time for most primates to kick the bucket.  That's when the oxytocin shuts off.  For any existence medical science has encouraged beyond that, we're just inventing the sociology as we go.

Space projects are not 'ultra-low-ROI'.  Like most basic research, their return on investment is *slow* rather than *small*.

I'm the same way. Do you have any idea how that happens? I've always wondered about it but honestly I've never looked into it.
The problem I see is that this academic work only sees part of the problem. In this case, you build a theoretical file system or wrapper to handle the traffic and on paper it looks great. However, once you get to the 'real world' you find that there is simply not enough money to deploy things like you want or the traffic varies enough to introduce different bottlenecks. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Real world' however could be better described as when you get to the deployment which requires multi disciplinary fields working together. If the academic work could take into account the financial logistics (economics), the physical space requirements (engineering), and even the administration of a team to handle such a specific system (management) then maybe it would yield more realistic results. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course that's not the point of specialized field study. If you had to take everything into account, you'd end up having to study things that don't interest you and spend less time developing a perfect file system  and more time working on the nuances of everything. newlinechar  newlinechar I was generalizing a bit with my statement. Of course academic work is important. But until it is applied and deployed in a real world application, it is merely there to look at and admire.

Often that decision hurts other people (like those who hoard food/water/medicine end up hurting people who legitimately need those things).

Sure, but a recursive descent parser is not always what you want. Imagine you're writing a GUI program that parses what comes in on a socket, it's nice to have the state machine generated by the parser generator, that way when you detect that a read would block, you can re-enter the message pump to redraw your GUI while waiting for input. Another example is multiplexing several clients in a server: each client can have its own state machine (possibly with different protocols, or just different instances of the same protocol) and when a would-block read happens, just re-enter the main select loop and switch to another socket that's ready to read.

Weak. When was this guy around, like 150 years ago? Kurzweil hadn't discovered the law of accelerating returns yet.  newlinechar  newlinechar Data in biological databases is growing exponentially with an average doubling time of _1.2 years_, that's much faster than Moore's law, which operates at ~1.8 years. The LHC will gather 15 petabytes of data every year.

It wasn’t so much that I didn’t like *FMJ*, but that I liked *Platoon* better.  In any case, Kubrick can be something of an acquired taste.  I’ve liked one of his movies, but not the next, until I developed an appreciation for his craft and style...  I thought *Clockwork Orange* and *Strangelove* were great, but I didn’t like *2001*.  Then I was in the minority that liked *Eyes Wide Shut*. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Different directors do different things.  John Ford makes one movie and Roman Polanski makes another, but you could still watch the oeuvre of either as sort of one long movie.  There would be too many disjuncts to do that with Kubrick.  The only consistent thing I see in Kubrick is his determined assault on the prevailing zeitgeist. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The other consistent thing is that he tried to expand his range by taking a different approach every time out.  Maybe he put it all together, as best he could (which is not too shabby) with *Eyes Wide Shut*. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I saw *Salvador* and liked it.

ok. I'll say as much as I can without incriminating myself. newlinechar  newlinechar * I have never had any significant relationships in my entire life. I went out with a girl for about a week a long time ago but it was frankly ridiculous. I've had some close calls before the cancer but I was too pussy to act on these opportunities. Anyways. newlinechar  newlinechar * I still live with my parents and I've been unemployed since December. I still pay my own bills with my savings and I mostly eat out so my parents only take care of the rent, if you want to call it that. newlinechar  newlinechar As for my relationship with them, my mom is about the most religious person I have ever met. Because of this she is very close minded so I don't like talking to her about anything. She went through the same cancer as me at the same age, and then was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago, so needless to say she is a tough person. However, unbeknownst to her we just about disagree on every subject ever brought up. I just don't bother arguing with her. She is also very pushy and insists on taking control of my life and giving me guidelines and shit which can really drive me crazy at times. For this reason I am rarely at home, or if I am I lock myself in my room or the bathroom and stay on my laptop. newlinechar  newlinechar ok so *maybe* I have some issues with my mom. That was a long-ass paragraph. newlinechar  newlinechar My dad works in Dubai. We see him around 4 months a year which isn't so bad but it still sucks for him. He is a very logical, rational person and I look up to him a lot. I wish I could have his sense of organization and will power. We are on good terms. newlinechar  newlinechar However my parents would not react well to bisexuality. My dad would be very disappointed, and my mom would probably try to exorcize me. newlinechar  newlinechar * I go to the gym 3-4 times a week, but no group sports. I want to try skydiving in summer and get a license so I can start going every weekend. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm unemployed due to too much schoolwork. I'm in a science program, and my grades have been deteriorating ever since the cancer. I'm not planning on quitting school because I wouldn't be able to survive without a degree in something. newlinechar  newlinechar * Not on any medications. Tried taking provigil for a while but it didn't really solve my core issues, just suppressed the symptoms a little (this is not what I am looking for). newlinechar  newlinechar * I've taken psilocybin mushrooms, salvia, ecstasy, amphetamine, codeine, DXM, DMT, morphine, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and possibly some other stuff I can't remember. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't drink alcohol regularly. I rarely, if ever, get wasted out of my mind, and instead prefer just getting a little tipsy so I'm comfortable but not acting like an idiot. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm addicted to [Dokha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokha), an Iranian tobacco that everyone smokes in Dubai. I encountered it on a trip there, took some back home and have been taking 3-5 puffs a day ever since. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm growing increasingly used to having a cup of coffee every few days. I wouldn't say I'm addicted but every time it's available I'm becoming less and less likely to turn it down. I think it could potentially develop into an addiction, if you could call it that.
Putting in my .02, I commented in a different fork that I'd had a similar experience.  (In fact I had the privilege of going to his trial for kidnapping her.) We were together for a while, then just friends for a while. Finally I got good and hammered and called her on her behavior patterns and her unwillingness to seek counseling.  The lesson I've learned here is that if she's not doing what it takes to help her move on, and doing it of her own initiative: you're most likely pissing up-stream.
&gt; If you are taught it doesn't matter what you do then you will only do things for your own personal gain. This is not true in the real world, in the real world some people are assholes and some people are not. newlinechar  newlinechar That's a fair point; there are indeed nice people in the world. newlinechar  newlinechar But even nice people are subject to the tyranny of the first impression. As a species, we human beings are inherently image oriented, and it's biological. When someone first meets you, they judge you on your clothes and your demeanor at that small moment in time. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, it would be wiser to defer all judgment until they knew you better - had a little more data to go on. But almost nobody can manage to do that. People are too busy, or to mentally lazy, or whatever. Even nice people fall prey to this. And the not-nice people (which there are also a good number of), well... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Lets say I also know how to cure cancer. Should I cure cancer because I know it is the right thing to do or should I say 'you know what? Fuck them, they are still going to hate me anyway'? newlinechar  newlinechar You're not familiar with decision-making inside the pharmaceutical industry, are you? 'Fuck 'em, we're not developing a cheap cure for (X disease or condition)' is *exactly* the logic they employ.
Simple reason that universal health care is necessary: newlinechar  newlinechar We have a law that says that a hospital must treat a life-threatening injury, whether the injured party has insurance or not.  Practically, it would be impossible to get rid of this law.  If you go into the hospital in a coma, it'll be pretty damn hard for you to pull out your insurance card before treatment. newlinechar  newlinechar But that means that some people will get treatment who can't pay for it.  There's no way to avoid this.  So hospitals go into debt, and many shut down.  And do you ever wonder why your insurance premiums are so high?  Part of it is because hospitals charge you extra to cover those people who can't pay. newlinechar  newlinechar You're already paying for other people's health care, and there's no way to avoid it.  All we're doing right now is hiding those costs in a ridiculously convoluted system where you have no idea how much a medical procedure really costs.

You're terribly mistaken. All public hospitals in the US are required to accept anybody in the emergency room or urgent care for any reason at all.

That's the thing though, you should only be given antibiotics for bacterial infections that you won't get better from or that are life threatening. Most respiratory infections are viral and you get better from in short order. newlinechar  newlinechar Giving them antibiotics would be more than likely counterproductive to your friends/acquaintances and everyone else they may come in contact with while those people are infectious. It's not a carrot on a stick. If you show symptoms of a disease a doctor will be better positioned to diagnose it and prescribe a course of action, usually just resting, that will help the person get better sooner and won't leave them with in a worse spot.
I thinks I know wat you is sayin! LOL
Of course not. By all means, in a free society, it would be a noble thing to help out a child in need. I know I will when I have the means; a lot of kids get stuck with shitty situations.

Agreed.  The problem is the inconsistent behavior of System Tray icons.  I distinctly remember seeing someone left click on the Safely Remove icon, and realizing that I had only right clicked on it before because I had been conditioned by other System Tray icons that left-clicking either wouldn't respond or would give me little control. newlinechar  newlinechar IIRC, the typical (?) SysTray icon behavior from Windows 95 on was double-click for default behavior, right-click for finer control.  In this context, a single-left click has little or no precedence, and is non-sensical for trying to remove a single device. newlinechar  newlinechar This is a good example of ad hoc MS programming and demonstrates how the Windows user interface, despite some general consistencies, is so varied in its behaviors that it primarily teaches a growing set of arbitrary actions specific to an application or icon or menu.   The system tray has become (or maybe always was) a kind of functional junk drawer.

Bluntchris made a cogent argument. He said essentially 'why is it assumed that Jewish CEO's of media companies support Zionism?'

Asking as someone who's collectively bargained for both workers and employers: you do know that you are reciting rhetoric, don't you?  Unions don't make rules of working terms and conditions arbitrarily; they don't have that power in the United States. Employers, in the absence of organized labor _do_ (within the confines of established Labor Law of course, to which unions are subject as well).  Get the picture? newlinechar  newlinechar Rules in a union shop, i.e., the contract, are agreed to by both parties, and then ratified by the workers.  Once the contract is in force it's perfectly legitimate for either party to enforce it, and believe you me, employers play by the letter of the law here, usually with more money to spend, just as much as the union reps do.  After all, why shouldn't they?  They'd much rather not have a CBA in place so they could have the sole say in these matters, but if there is one, it's in their interest to enforce it.  If I thought power and control over something that I considered mine and mine only were threatened, I'd do the same, if only to keep from losing more control. newlinechar  newlinechar The entire notion of 'union rules' is a canard.  And, it doesn't matter if you or anyone else thinks organizing is 'obsolete'.  It's a matter of law.  Workers have the right to.  The Supreme Court ruled it so, and years of legislation codified it.  I guess you'll just have to live with that, eh?

Then you need to read your employee rights under the fair labor standards act, which should lawfully be poseted at the restaurant you work at. Under the tip credit clause it clearly states:  newlinechar  newlinechar 'Employers of tipped employees must pay a cash wage of at least $2.13 per hour if they claim a tip credit against their minimum wage obligation. If an employees tips, combined with the employer's cash wage of at least $2.13 per hour does not equal the minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference' newlinechar  newlinechar You also cannot claim you did not know this because: newlinechar  newlinechar If an employer elects to use the tip credit provision the employer must: newlinechar *1) Inform each tipped employee about the tip credit allowance (including amount to be credited) before the credit is utilized. newlinechar 2) Be able to show that the employee receives at least the minimum wage when direct wages and the tip credit allowance are combined. newlinechar 3) Allow the tipped employee to retain all tips, whether or not the employer elects to take a tip credit for tips received, except to the extent the employee participates in a valid tip pooling arrangement. newlinechar  newlinechar If you were paid less than minimum wage then you must not have been informed of the law either, and therefore should take them to court for lost wages + court fees + any other applicable rewards (often up to 3x the amount of lost wages) for violating not one but two sections of the fair labor and standards act. Also even if you are employed 'at will' they cannot fire you for reporting their illegal activities, and if they tried you could likely sue for lost wages during the time it takes you to find another job. newlinechar  newlinechar TLDR; newlinechar If you have been paid less than minimum wage in any tipped position it is a good thing, because you can get back those wages and then some . newlinechar  newlinechar Some more info on the FLSA and tipped employees: newlinechar http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs15.pdf newlinechar

If your logic were right that would only be a megabyte and you need 16 megabytes for the headers anyway, but... newlinechar  newlinechar This only reduces the size of strings that are exactly 15 bytes long.  Strings less than 15 bytes were handled by the old short string optimization and only use the 16 byte header object.  Strings greater than 15 require some heap allocation, which probably has a minimum size and some overhead.  Strings that are exactly 15 bytes would save you the overhead for heap allocation plus the minimum size of a heap allocation, which probably works out to several bytes.  So, if you have a million 15 byte strings this would probably save you a few megabytes, but if you have a million 14 byte or 16 byte strings this won't save you anything. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  Corrected header size (it is 16, not 12) and string lengths (15, not 16)

The proper role of government is to provide opportunity for everyone to succeed to the best of their ability and effort.  A more level playing field than that available in the dog-eat-dog societies of the past. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar A long-term sustainable society must, then, ensure a minimum level of health and safety for its citizens.

Elective surgeries should not be covered by society, for instance.  Effective vaccinations, on the other hand, should be free, readily available, and promoted for the better health of every citizen. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In between it can get grey.

He's saying that it was perfectly legal for Mr.Reidenberg to invade his privacy, but that it demonstrated poor judgment. newlinechar  newlinechar Where people got this idea that those who don't think anything and everything 'bad' should be illegal deserve to have bad things happen to them, I do not know. newlinechar  newlinechar If a supreme court justice says 'we don't need any further infringement upon the KKK's right to free speech' that doesn't mean that justice should have a 24/7 KKK rally on the sidewalk in front of their house. newlinechar  newlinechar Scalia has made it very clear that he believes free speech trumps the right to privacy, and this is a very defensible belief considering free speech is mentioned in the Constitution and privacy is not. newlinechar  newlinechar Laws made to protect privacy almost invariably infringe on free speech.  And, in the case of this event, Scalia said: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It is silly to think that every single datum about my life is private.  It is not a rare phenomenon that what is legal may also be quite irresponsible. That appears in the First Amendment context all the time. newlinechar  newlinechar If find that actually quite noble.  He's saying 'you're being a dick, but you're within your rights to be a dick in America.'  I see no hypocrisy in what Scalia has said here.
oh shit your right. i guess i read it and immediately saw into it my own situation a year ago. ok lets try this again. newlinechar  newlinechar going into the navy... newlinechar  newlinechar the service is a funny beast. you both love it and hate it at the same time. it is socialism. they will provide everything you need to survive. they give you a food allowance to eat, a housing allowance to live, a cost of living allowance due to inequities in regional costs and basic pay for everything else. you get payed the same every month no matter how many hours you work, and free medical. all you have to do is follow orders. newlinechar  newlinechar do what they say and they will give you everything you need. do your work and don't get into too much trouble (a little is encouraged) and they are happy. newlinechar  newlinechar the rub comes when you start to feel trapped. it is the same thing that befalls all socialist governments. some people just want to smoke a blunt every so often. some people are smarter then their superiors who don't listen to them. some people get fed up following orders that makes things worse. and i felt weary of the thought of complete submission. that was what doomed me. but you'll be ok. you will see that your time in the service will serve you, but don't stay in too long, it will rot your creativity and close your mind. just keep those things true and you can't be tainted.  newlinechar  newlinechar don't listen to those that have to need everything to be perfect, or those who do things below acceptable limits. do things moderately well and you will be valuable.  newlinechar  newlinechar stay away from married chicks. and if you do sleep with them always use a condom. i knocked up a married chick and left town before she even told me. the husband forbade her to tell me. i found out through the grapevine. i have a baby girl in alaska and i don't even know her name.  newlinechar  newlinechar let yourself get sucked into the culture, but don't start drinking every night. i have seen livers die this way. almost everyone starts smoking cigs, you can never quit forever so just try to quit every once in awhile it will be good for your health. newlinechar  newlinechar there is a strong anti-intellectual air in the service. only the losers care about that stuff. to survive you must become witty. you get better with practice. newlinechar  newlinechar it will both thrust maturity and immaturity on you. you will become both more crude and more confident. you will gain a lot of common sense and a lot of ignorance. you will become a lot more resilient mentally and physically. in the end you will see that it was good but it is time to move on. let your contract expire and separate. newlinechar  newlinechar all told you will be fine. you just need to make sure you don't become too much of anything. stay moderate in every respect and youll be fine. newlinechar  newlinechar that is my experience at least. someone elses could be different. good luck in everything you do. there is a lot of life you have to live ahead of you. just have lots of fun without getting yourself killed.

There is a serious disconnect between great films that are great because the plot and the acting create a dynamic tension that keeps your attention, and the flicks that just use CG wizardry and pyrotechnics that requires nothing of the viewer but a pair of eyes.   newlinechar  newlinechar 'Bad Day at Black Rock' with Spencer Tracy is a perfect example of this. newlinechar  newlinechar Those of us who like to walk out of a theater saying things like ' Whoa, that shit blowed up Reeeal good!' will be disappointed by  BDABR because there is one (count 'em) one, molotov cocktail that is used.

Thanks for the link. I saw this at the IFC theater at some festival in NYC when it fist came out a few years ago. Brilliant flick. I would give my left nut for a beard that cool.  I wish more redditors would read Zizek's *Sublime Object of Ideology*... might show them that even if you're a pro-Palestine, marijuana-smoking libertarian, you're still part of a state ideological apparatus...
I agree with this, although I'm not very tall for a women (I come from a very tall family, I'm the shorty at 5'6' and change), I've been with both short and tall men.  I honestly prefer guys to be closer to my height.  Neck cramps suck if the guys are too tall.  Not to mention I have legs that belong on a woman that's 5'9', so my preference of 5'8' to 5'10' men evens out beautifully.  It makes some standing activities very nice, if you get my drift.  My boyfriend who's 5'8' has always ended up with women that are just above 5 foot though... I'm rare for him.  At least he can't use me as a arm rest. Yes I'm taller than him when I wear heels but I could care less. newlinechar  newlinechar I could care less if a man is a boob man, leg men or ass man.  It's all preferences.  Whatever floats your boat.  I just run when someone admits to having a red head fetish. =P

No, that isn't parody, or at least not parody done well. They took a song that had no message whatsoever and they 'parodied' it by making a noun-heavy opinion piece, pretty much all they did was take the beat and vocal melodies and played off the success of *talented* comedians.

&gt;is this guy saying the internet archive doesn't do (albeit in a very different way) the same thing? newlinechar  newlinechar Controlling access by sticking a price onto access of media and not allowing libraries to use the resulting digital copies they receive in whatever manner their choose is not much of a comparison to 'controlling access' by making it publicly available, for free, with no restrictions on anyone.

I don't understand how this happens. Don't you have to sign a thingy with the total on it when paying by credit card? newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I'm from the UK, so not familiar with the way you process credit cards. Over here, in the distant past you would get a sheet with carbon paper which your card details would be impressioned on by a little device with a roller and the total filled in with a pen - there are copies for you, the card company and the retailer. Until recently you would get a printed thingy from the card processing machine, which you signed. Now you usually get a handheld terminal and insert your card and enter your PIN. In every case you get to see how much you are authorising there and then.
As with most problems in the world I don't feel the need to dictate how we should fix them. I usually end up just stepping back from it all and observing, wondering how it will all play out.

One could argue that if she is unable/unwilling to acknowledge homosexuality as an acceptable behavior, then she is ethically obligated to refer the patient to another counselor in order to keep from allowing her personal values from intruding her professional work. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, while it would certainly be wrong for her to make judgements to her patient about their sexuality in a counselling session, perhaps it's a valid compromise to find her patient a more qualified counselor.

There's similar discussion in John Allen Paulos' book [Innumeracy](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809058405/), though he approaches it from a different route to the same result. I once used that method in a discussion with someone who was talking about mandatory drug testing for high-school students, and demonstrated that the test (IIRC, a 98% accuracy rate -- 98% of drug users test positive, 2% of non-users test positive) probably shouldn't inspire the level of confidence in guilt that he wanted to have.

What i find interesting with that argument is that typically when gay people want to get married they are pledging exclusivity to that person.  They say things like I take you and no other.

Ya I get ya I'm just saying...well I'll give you an example. A buddy of mine's sister got into heroin and was staying with a guy that was pimping her out.  My friend was in HS at the time and was a linebacker about 6'-2'  230,  big guy. One day his mom says to him 'Jamie, let's go we are getting your sister'  they show up at the apartment and start packing up her stuff when they are almost done the pimp, heroin supply guy shows up...now he is heroin sheek, skinny.  He starts talking a little smack and looks like he is going to lunge for the sister so the mom says 'Jamie get him!'  Jamie proceeds to punch and punch and punch, he couldn't stop. It took his mom, sister and 4 people passing by to pull him off, he would have killed the guy.  I asked him how it felt and he said 'like smashing all the evil in the world with my hands, I wanted to kill him'.  Now no way the guy deserves to die for being a pimp but you get caught up and it involves someone you love you just can't stop.  It isn't right, the guy should just go to jail but I can't blame a guy for getting caught up.

You're trying to throw out 250 years of jurisprudence, as well as the effects of the 10th and 14th amendments. newlinechar  newlinechar The right to have one's religious belief, or not have one, is a right held by the people. *All* levels of government are enjoined from violating that right, regardless of the limitation in the original wording. newlinechar  newlinechar Again: newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(Bill_of_Rights%29 newlinechar  newlinechar and an explanation: newlinechar http://www.class.uidaho.edu/mickelsen/Media%20Readings/Incorporation_Doctrine.htm newlinechar

Such a finding would require a teacher to tailor his  newlinechar     comments so as not to offend or disagree with any religious group.  This would be  newlinechar     unworkable given the number of different religious viewpoints on various issues.  newlinechar     This would also be directly contrary to the fundamental principles of Establishment  newlinechar     Clause jurisprudence because it would require a teacher to attempt to teach in  newlinechar     accordance with certain religious principles. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem wasn't that he was saying things Christians might disagree was.

I quoted an excerpt elsewhere that merely saying something Christians disagree with, especially in the context of teaching secular material, is not at issue. newlinechar  newlinechar Eg: newlinechar  newlinechar T: 'The world is approximately 4.5 billion years old.' newlinechar  newlinechar S: 'No, the Bible tells me it's only 6000 years old.' newlinechar  newlinechar T: 'You're free to believe as you choose, but this class adheres to the findings of modern science, and so you'll be required to know the age as it's scientifically understood.' newlinechar  newlinechar The problem was that the teacher's statement did not have any overarching secular purpose, but instead represented a religious viewpoint, and so failed the three-prong Lemon test. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.ocregister.com/newsimages/2009/05/01/Student%20lawsuit%20-%20final%20ruling.pdf newlinechar  newlinechar Page 8: 'Thus, Corbett’s in-class opinions on various social or political issues not  newlinechar touching upon religion do not violate the Establishment Clause, regardless of  newlinechar whether those of a particular religious faith might disagree with or find his  newlinechar statements offensive.  Therefore, any of Corbett’s statements which do not touch  newlinechar upon or mention religion satisfy the Lemon test and do not violate the  newlinechar Establishment Clause. ' newlinechar  newlinechar I recommend reading through the ruling. The judge is in fact incredibly tolerant towards Corbett, finding that in most cases, his statements were either secular in nature or permissible within their context of discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Similarly, it appears that Corbett’s referral to religion as “irrational” had the primary effect of demonstrating how religion can be used as a manipulative tool.12  (See Farnan’s Ex. A, p. 24.)  It is not improper for an AP European History teacher to discuss how religion can intersect with social and political choices.' newlinechar  newlinechar and newlinechar  newlinechar 'These statements cannot be reasonably construed as primarily disapproving of  newlinechar religion.  Corbett explicitly states that he is not drawing a causal connection but  newlinechar merely pointing out a correlation.  The statement that there is a correlation between church attendance and crime rates is an interesting sociological fact appropriate for a college level discussion and seems to only suggest disapproval of religion by way of speculation or inference.' newlinechar  newlinechar Onto pages 26-28 he discusses Corbett's discussion of religious belief about the Sun &amp; Earth, versus our scientific understanding. So even though he's directly confronting traditional Christian beliefs, the judge finds that these statements had merit in a classroom for the sake of discussion of history. newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, it looks like the plaintiff's lawyers exaggerated just how good this ruling was for them. They won, partially, on only a single statement. The school was absolved, and the rest of the statements were ruled as non-infringing. newlinechar  newlinechar Whoever above made antagonistic statements against this judge is clearly ignorant. This judge has thought this matter through carefully, displayed his reasoning very clearly, and erred very much on the side of free academic discussion, only finding that Corbett stepped over the line once, when he said of creationist beliefs that they are 'religious, superstitious nonsense.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I think that there are many illustrative things in the past that have many parallels with present Christians and their way of thinking, and Christians will often listen about that stuff, because they don't see it as you directly criticising them.

I've always liked the idea of being in an open relationship, and the idea of my girlfriend sleeping with another guy really turns me on.  However, this falls into the category of a sexual fantasy that adds to our sex life, not something I would just 'allow' her to do because I don't care who she sleeps with.  When she and I are on rocky emotional ground, the idea isn't as appealing.  It's only when we're really connecting and I'm really enjoying her that I like the idea. newlinechar  newlinechar My girlfriend (and a few other girls I've told) really like the idea of being in a stable and loving relationship where they can be sexually free with others.  However, when they try to imagine allowing their boyfriends that freedom, they hate the idea. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the explanation for this is that for my girlfriend to sleep with a guy, she doesn't have to make any emotional overtures to him.  She can just say 'hey, I'm hot, fuck me'.  But for me to sleep with a girl, I have to prove to her that I'm emotionally committed, I have to make her believe that she's the center of my world and that I'm devoted to her.  Or, I have to get her drunk or trick her.  If my girlfriend understands this on some level, I can see why she hates the idea of me being with another girl. newlinechar  newlinechar I doubt that the original poster's wife is getting off on the idea.

The sexual feelings work here like they would with pornography in general -- they try to make an illusion seem real.  People are really looking for *emotional intimacy*, that feeling of being known and accepted for who they really are, but for whatever reason they feel reality cannot give it to them.  To be explicit for a moment here, an orgasm is strong enough to make those needs *seem* like they're being met, when they really aren't. newlinechar  newlinechar It is probably common to sometimes have feelings of closeness with children which cause alarm but are normal.  For example, an adult might enjoy a quality in a child such as their sense of humor or silliness and appreciate that trait in a same-aged partner.

Maybe it's like how we break down big problems into smaller, solvable problems, we also break down complex shapes into simple ones to better process them.

Anyone who sympathizes with them and speaks against it clearly also hates Jews. newlinechar  newlinechar I wrote the comment purely tongue in cheek, else I would have articulated it in a bit more depth. It's not inaccurate, though.
Zionism isn't a religious thing. newlinechar  newlinechar On the contrary, the man who originated the concept, Herzel, was a die-hard secularist who thought at first that the best solution for the Jewish persecution problem, would be to become seculars and assimilate in the host societies. newlinechar  newlinechar But then, when he realized that even the most secular of Jews will be persecuted (at the Dryfus trial), he decided the only way persecution will stop is if there's a state that allowed Jews to come, and not persecute them. newlinechar  newlinechar Herzel originally wanted the state to be in Uganda - but others pressed that it be set up in the historical homeland of the Jews. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, if it was in Uganda, it'd probably be no different. newlinechar  newlinechar The idea was to cooperate and live side by side in peace with the natives of the land. But the natives had other plans. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: btw: What's your solution to the Jewish persecution problem, assuming its now 1880?
It also explains all of those lawsuits against the studios by talent claiming they didn't get their proper share of the profits. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, they _did_ get their share of the profits the film actually made, but not of the profits inflated with laundered money.

Or a certain state intent on shaping the foreign policy of a superpower to its liking, using its resources to further the careers of politicians (including Jews) in order to achieve same.
Maybe it's just a different point of view. In Europe most countries have Data Protection legislation which don't allow this kind of information into the public domain. We don't see this as a freedom of speech issue but a matter of basic privacy. In fact, it seems bizarre to me that you should claim the right to know as much as you would like about an individual and say this is freedom of speech.
I disagree at their heights both the Ancient Egyptian empire and the Roman empire were incredibly diverse.
That's fair though. Extend the logic to an extreme case to see if it still holds. If it doesn't, it is bad logic. As long as you aren't actually comparing people to hitler, then Godwin's law is meaningless. As it stands, lithium is also misinterpreting the logic.
That's yet another parallel between genetics and memetics.  For example, British accents differ from each other more widely than American accents do.

I even collect them, in fact. newlinechar  newlinechar My spelling and grammar is excellent, or at least I hope it is. newlinechar  newlinechar Despite all the vidya games, both my younger brother and I are Boy Scouts (I'm an adult leader, actually), he plays D&amp;D on occasion, and I'm in the process of starting my own business, which, without going in to too much detail, will pretty much revolve around video games. newlinechar  newlinechar All I'm saying is, it is in fact possible to play a whole lot of video games growing up and still be a decent and productive human being. newlinechar  newlinechar I for one plan on introducing my eventual children to the wonderful world of video games at a very young age. I could think of a million reasons why, but I doubt you really want to read that much more anyway.

Interesting ideas...  I think ideally it would be a nice picture if one's income directly represented societal worth, but in some ways a rich person (or even an heir) does add value to society in a unique way. newlinechar  newlinechar Rich people either manage their own wealth or hire other people to manage it for them.  Either way, they're either paying for it in opportunity cost (couldn't do something else with that time and effort) or literally putting food on someone else's table for doing the work for them. newlinechar  newlinechar A good money manager (no inside information, not a cheat, liar, etc.) certainly has positive utility to society.  They put (at least temporarily or conditionally) money in the hands of normal working people like us to make something good out of it, giving us a chance of building up a probably smaller but similar stack of wealth to pass down to our kids to try to do the same. newlinechar  newlinechar The old economics identity Savings = Investment is kind of the soothing factor here.  Every dollar that a fat cat, pensioner, or young investor sits on (doesn't spend) is ultimately going into the hands of somebody with an idea, who works or pays others to work.  We have at least, through capital markets, figured that much out. newlinechar  newlinechar Where I have a problem is when this sort of pragmatic meritocracy steers itself into the political or other social arenas.  Here is where I completely agree with you, only replacing income/salary with power.  We have to do something about this, because running some significant chunk of a country is not like getting a seat on the board of a non-profit for donating huge amounts of money. newlinechar  newlinechar I recall reading that the original vision of a politician in the US was kind of a citizen-advocate, hauled away from ordinary life by an admiring community to go and make good, level-headed decisions.  We've turned that into a complete mess of chaos through allowing and encouraging career politicians.
I'm sorry but I won't be of much help there. It is extremely difficult to find any identities of Red Army musicians, because none were given any kind of prestige aside from the conductors.

Section A: newlinechar 1) We are a part of the American Baptist denomination - a mainline protestant tradition. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) My church is over 100 years old.  We have an average attendance on Sunday morning of about 230.  We are in a conservative, shrinking community.  Our county has about 30,000 people in it. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) I am 24 newlinechar  newlinechar Section B: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) I attended a Christian university.  I had required courses in all areas of humanities, courses in adolescent psychology, counseling, Bible, theology, philosophy, history, literature, theory of ministry/youth ministry, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) I felt called to ministry when I was a Junior in high school.  At the time I wanted to be a recording engineer. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) I like this question a lot.  I am a young guy, but teens make me feel old.  I have a LOT to learn about adulthood, but I'm amazed at how able I truly am to help teenagers.  I just got a text from a student today about an issue she's facing and I love being able to be a part of students' lives and growth in faith.  All ministry has ups and downs, and it is tough work because you can't always see what you are accomplishing, but I find it very rewarding on the whole. newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Discipleship means one follower of Jesus teaching younger/less mature followers of Jesus about what it means to follow Jesus.  We have implemented a discipleship process through age-based small group meetings. newlinechar  newlinechar 5) They care a lot but inquire little.  I like to think its because they trust me, but i'm not always so sure. newlinechar  newlinechar --You didn't ask, but I'll tell you that I think the single most important factor in going in to ministry is whether or not you have felt called.  It gets tough enough that, without feeling like God has recruited you for this work, you'll struggle.  And if you do feel called, don't run from that.  It doesn't work out well.

Dickless? It's called tact which a teacher should have. This isn't you arguing with some friends or having a debate on the internet. A teacher should use some tact. newlinechar  newlinechar If a student said that things fall up the teacher should explain the laws of gravity, not tell the student that what they think is stupid or nonsense. Nothing is gained by treating your students as idiots or being demeaning. Telling someone their ideas are ridiculous isn't ok for a teacher to say to a student. That does not create an open environment for discussion which is what one of the jobs of a teacher is.  newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine if every time you made a comment or shared an opinion the teacher told you that it was ridiculous. You wouldn't want to share your opinions and it would make other students much less likely to share their opinions. That goes against the entire purpose of school.

Saying we should be able to fileshare is not the same thing as saying musicians should work for free.   newlinechar  newlinechar As a filesharer, I don't buy a lot of albums, but I do give the artists that I really appreciate more exposure.  Although I'm stealing their work, I'll end up paying to see their concerts when they come through my city, and it is likely I'll bring along friends who are appreciating their music as well. newlinechar  newlinechar As a musician I feel the same way.  If someone gets a crack at my music for free and is digging it, the most I hope for is that they'll show it to some of their friends.  If they really identify with it, maybe they'll come see a concert.  On the whole though, I'd just like the most people possible to hear my music.  For a while now, bands haven't been making shit off selling albums; might as well have some people hear the music if they aren't gonna pay for it anyway.

Plenty of rich people simply have money because they're talented and/or smart.  Those people still have a heart.

That video's a bunch of bullshit. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeesh, the stupidity of that video is overwhelming.  I don't even know where to begin. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not about co-opting.  It's not about stickin' it to The Man.  And it is certainly not about taking pride in 'we have arrived'.  We have arrived?  What the fuck?  Does he mean that because everyone 'sold out' that it's okay?  It's the thing to do? newlinechar  newlinechar It's about reducing the meaning of a given thing to 'BUY!'  It's about the power of that message.  It's about how pervasive that message is.  It's about ow, if you let it happen, everything about you is reduced to your consumption habits. newlinechar  newlinechar And it's not about being a 'moron' and being tricked by the clever advertisers (and if Henry Rollins thinks that advertising operates on this superficial level of 'oh, they played that song I liked, I'll buy that' then he doesn't know what he's talking about), it's about realizing that nothing is immune to consumer culture and that everything, even your identity, is for sale. newlinechar  newlinechar It's about realizing that there is no escape from it, that you can 'Rage Against the Machine' all you want, and you can even RATM on Rock Band.  It's about the consumption of 'cool'.  It's about the simulation of reality becoming reality itself.  It's about drowning in simulacra.  And it's realizing that authenticity is dead and that all of modern life is experienced through a layer of ironic removal, that it is impossible to have an authentic, passionate moment without consciously being aware of its parallel in media, and wondering if your moment is real and yours or if you just saw it in a movie once or if you're just recreating a feeling a photograph gave you.  And what all of that means for how you choose to live.  And if that even matters. newlinechar  newlinechar And that's why it makes us sad. newlinechar  newlinechar Added: Which is also why we hate shitty art.  Why we hate Sex and the City.  And other such shit art that makes no attempt to actually try to portray reality and instead sells a new fantasy.  It's why people end up as anorexics.  Why people chase ideal images of body.  Why people chase material ideals.  And why, when meaningful passionate moments occur, regardless of their parallel in media, they are not to be believed. newlinechar  newlinechar Art is how you rehearse for life, and when anything that is good because it's meaningful is then reduced to the simple snake charmer's call, you are still rehearsing for life - one of consumerism. newlinechar  newlinechar Consumerism is not merely buying things.  Everyone does that and everyone needs to do that.  It's about deriving meaning from purchases. newlinechar  newlinechar This rant is so far offtopic now.  I'm just going to stop and leave it here. newlinechar  newlinechar All the above being said, I don't mind Sigur Ros being used in an ad trying to promote understanding of eating disorders.  I'm kind of in love with a woman with an eating disorder (it's complicated) and I wish I could fix her.  If Sigur Ros can help, I welcome their aid.

So just to build upon Nico's question, what does it really mean to throw one's back out?  I doubt it's a bulged disc like described above.

the old testament is written explicitly around the Jews being the chosen people.

I used to work in the semiconductor industry - Applied Materials, Intel and Agilent.  High precision parts that Clipboard is referring to are made for the semiconductor equipment.  Some were made by small manufacturers that were indeed mom and pop.  My second to last job in the high tech industry was solely for the purpose of consolidating all parts manufacturing to Malaysia. newlinechar  newlinechar So, what Clipboard is talking about is that he was a supplier to, probably, an equipment company like Applied Materials who in turn sold their equipment to the likes of Intel.  Until the last decade or so, Asia simply didn't have the capacity to manufacture high precision parts in high demand - even though they had the fabs.  The fabs were subsidized by the governments for this very purpose - by bringing in the fabs, the supporting manufacturing base would sprout up.   newlinechar  newlinechar Believe me, the corporate executives were driving this thing.  We were faxing drawings of parts like crazy just trying to find companies that could make the stuff.  The material cost savings were considerable... but there was a loss in customer service (due to disconnect between design and manufacturing) and quality - at least initially.   newlinechar  newlinechar I miss the work and being part of the high tech stuff.  It was great working on multi-million dollar piece of machinery and making it work.

&gt; You need to produce things to trade them for what you need to survive. newlinechar  newlinechar Ah, but there's the rub.  If I'm sick, I can't produce things, thus making it difficult to trade those things for the care I need to get better and be able to produce things. newlinechar  newlinechar The poorer I am, the more likely I am to randomly get stuck in a rut where I'm unable to work my way back out. newlinechar  newlinechar All of this is not even mentioning the human decency that comes from guaranteeing everyone the basic supplies for life.  But expecting voluntary charity to solve these problems is naive; read up on the 'Tragedy of the Commons'.  In a nutshell, it would benefit all of society for the crazy homeless guy who walks down my street to get clean, get a job, and start contributing to society.  Or, if that's not possible, at least put him up somewhere and let him eat and drink himself into oblivion on society's dime; it's still better than letting him fall into petty crimes which have a huge cost to the victims. newlinechar  newlinechar But I'm not going to pay for it; if nobody else is paying, then I'm spending my money (which I worked for) to benefit myself slightly and everyone else more--a sucker's move.  Or if everyone else is paying, then I might as well let them take care of it and save my money for myself.  But when the government takes my money and uses it to help him, I have a fair belief that everyone else is paying a bit, too, so I don't feel bad about it. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, I know there are flaws in my plan, too, especially relating to removing the disincentives of having too many offspring.  But those are solvable problems, too!
Yup very true, they own a lot of extremely reputable journals, like Cell. Elsevier being stupid does not in any way or form change the gems in their collection, which publishes some of the best research in academia/industry. They also have no say really, as these are all peer-reviewed and typically have boards from the top names in academia.  newlinechar  newlinechar No researcher will care about what Elsevier does in their 'spare time.' If they do, they probably couldn't get their stuff into Cell, Lancet, Journal of Molecular Bio, etc anyway.  newlinechar  newlinechar I do agree though, I know a few top journals found a cheaper publisher and left Elsevier, I hope/wish more followed suit.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I don't think that the fed feels that it is bound by the law, or at least the spirit of the law.  The fed is prohibited by law from buying many of the types of assets it has been dealing in, particularly mortgage backed securities.  Instead, in many cases, including the Bear Stearns case, they set up a special purpose entity that buys the assets with borrowed money from the fed.  This entity's only assets are the securities in question, and therefore cannot pay back more than their ultimate sale price.  As a provision of the loan, the entity agrees to pay the fed any profit it makes from the sale of these securities. newlinechar  newlinechar Please tell me how when the fed does things like this, which are obviously functionally equivalent to a purchase, when a purchase is illegal, that they should be expected to wind down lending when the 'need is no longer urgent.'  I'm assuming that the fed gets to determine when 'the need is no longer urgent.'

&gt;  Am I missing something? newlinechar  newlinechar Not anything too relevant, really. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I always assumed the body went into hypovolemic shock because it was trying to maintain oxygen levels with less blood [...] newlinechar  newlinechar Well, the hypovolemic in hypovolemic shock literally means 'low volume'.  It's a positive feedback cycle; the loss of blood volume reduces the amount of volume that passes through the heart, causing both immediate hypoxia but more importantly also eliminating the ability to remove the wastes of the oxygen cycle (CO2, etc), as well as the detritus from the ensuing anaerobic processes.  I.e.; it induces sudden, immediate toxic shock.   newlinechar  newlinechar It also has the effect of rupturing several other internal organs -- such as the lungs -- which is where the shallow breathing comes from (the fact that your lungs fill w/ fluid).  The kidneys rupture and shut down, often allowing urea and all sorts of nasty 'gifts' back into the bloodstream. newlinechar  newlinechar The brain is usually one of the least affected (the brain/blood barrier) but even there, the loss in fluid volume can do nasty things. It's hard to get an exact description of what happens during major blood loss; there's little interest in studying the process as opposed to preventing it. newlinechar  newlinechar While yes, oxygen deprivation does occur, the traumas associated with blood loss go much, much further than this.  Even if you perfused the blood remaining in the body during blood-loss w/ pure bioavailable oxygen, a person who experiences significant blood loss (40% + ) will die, from massive internal organ failure and toxic shock.

You don't only take on obligations from signing a contract, but there are many other ways, including orally. newlinechar  newlinechar These including your actions from presenting yourself as a trustee and operating your trust in commerce... newlinechar  newlinechar  - [The Artificial Person (corporate-entity) as a 'Trust'](http://www.tpuc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1279) newlinechar  newlinechar Also read this as an introduction, which applies similarly to the Trust that is the United States of America... newlinechar  newlinechar - [Members of a private society since birth...](http://www.tpuc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1697) newlinechar  newlinechar - [The People and the Trust](http://1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/pvc.htm) newlinechar  newlinechar - [The Constitution is a Trust Indenture - Reprint from an answer Governor Madsen provided to Jay Rutledge](http://teamlawproductions.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=716) newlinechar  newlinechar If you are quote an 'Act' or some other legislation that contracts need to be signed, or *acting* the role of the 'Citizen' or some other created *legal-entity* under the jurisdiction of the United States (or some other *entity*), then you are only operating according to the rules of that private society. newlinechar  newlinechar But the binding rules are what you do as a sovereign - as one of the people - and for this obligation can arise in a number of ways, not only by written signature or seal. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 'by breathing you agree to....' is plain and simple fraud newlinechar  newlinechar That's of course silly. newlinechar  newlinechar But you can still accept things by silent acquiescence which is one way you are bound into the system.

because if you get a fine peice of protein and completly destroy it, it makes you a moron. you have just wasted an expensive and formally delicious peice of food than any non-moron could have otherwise enjoyed. it's a matter of opinion and taste, in a chef's (or in my case, a 'cook' who would never call himself a chef and who laughs at 98% of people who claim to be 'chefs') opinion, it's moronic to destroy food and then eat it, doing so also indicates to chefs'/cooks that you have very poor taste, and your presence in their restarant therefor has bad connotations, given transitive properties and all.

Its true about the cost ratio. I am a cook at a chain restaurant, but its owned by a large franchise that owns 15 different restaurants. And we are the flagship restaurant in Canada for this chain. So everyone are cooks and only the sous chef and the chef have their Red Seals (Chef certificate) My friends dad has it, and he works in one of the best catering + restaurants in the City. And you need to be at least on your level 3 (meaning you have to have done more than just be enrolled in culinary school)   newlinechar  newlinechar This makes this chain a unique one. Its sub owned by a company that prides in its quality, so everything is top notch. We pull in between 40-100K a week (we are a provincial capital in the mid-west of Canada)  newlinechar  newlinechar The only thing I have learned about this industry, is that I hate having them (the chain) beating down my back to do ALL my work and be out in 6 hrs. Ugh and the cuts, sores on feet, sketchy waitresses, being a dish bitch. Also I hate how many kids don`t have knife skills and don`t know basic words such as Julienned, Butterflied, Bakers, Mashers, Expo.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also hate how most people I work with are alcoholics, somewhat dysfunctional (I can be at times due to heavy stress), and are heavy drug users.   newlinechar  newlinechar Also since I`m just a cook, I get paid dick. My old boss is now making $35 an hour + tips in a city where a nice apartment can be bought for 300-500 dollars. newlinechar  newlinechar **tl;dr - Franchise restaurants are decent depending on the companies outlook, but the people you work with are often sketchy.

&gt;so your comparison isn't merited newlinechar  newlinechar While the scale is different, I think the comparison is fair. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I strongly contend that the oppression of the Palestinians is nowhere near the persecution suffered by the Jews. newlinechar  newlinechar Without a doubt. However, it is still persecution. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So would the English really be doing the world a favor if they had prevented Jewish escape into Israel? newlinechar  newlinechar It’s not an issue of preventing, but rather one of just staying out of other people’s business. They damaged India/Pakistan, resulting in the massive loss of life during the Partition, there involvement in India resulted in the rise of Wahabbism and the consequent problems that we still face, they made convenient political division of the Middle East and Africa that have resulted in massive genocides and ethnic cleansings, have interfered in other countries internal politics leaving their governments in tatters and prone to the rise of regimes like Hussein in Iraq (and so the current war) and the Shah in Iran and so the current Islamist government. newlinechar  newlinechar All I was suggesting was that they let the situation alone. If Jews wanted to migrate to Palestine, they could have done it without a colonial sponsor. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Note that those Jews had nowhere to go, even the US had closed its doors to Jewish immigration. newlinechar  newlinechar And now we have the same problem with Palestinians. Even the local Arab nations have closed their doors. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Zionism is not about entitlement. newlinechar  newlinechar It may not have meant that, but it means that now. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Immigrating and setting up a state somewhere necessarily means some natives might be offended -- *but its a lesser evil than persecution*. newlinechar  newlinechar Apparently not. We still have persecution - and a volatile geopolitical situation with two sides now showing extremism and the (hopefully low) risk of nuclear exchange. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They were not supposed to be dispossessed. newlinechar  newlinechar Sad. But the road to hell is paved with good intentions. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They were supposed to be granted equal rights in a state with the immigrating Jews. newlinechar  newlinechar That would have been ideal. Though I think there is an indication of arrogance there. More realistically, the immigrating Jews would have been granted equal rights with the resident already there. That is a Freudian slip showing a feeling of entitlement I suggest ;) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I don't think most people at that time would predict that to be such a huge problem with the natives. newlinechar  newlinechar Hmmm. People didn’t predict that invading Iraq would result in chaos and mayhem… No. We did. People didn’t predict that the Vietnam war would result in chaos and mayhem… No. Our parents did. People didn’t predict that our Government’s interference in Indigenous affairs would result in socioeconomic collapse… Oops, yes people did again. newlinechar  newlinechar That those in power didn’t see the obvious is not an indication that it was an unfortunately unforeseeable situation, but rather than those in power are fools.

An alliance with India would not be a mistake, per se.

Without Pakistan's permission to allow the US to supply the troops via Pakistan, the US forces in Afghanistan would wither on the vine. Pakistan would certainly not look kindly on Indian forces being present on both the eastern and western borders of Pakistan.

What's more the distributions of wealth, jobs, influence, responsibility and so one vary with time and with culture.   newlinechar  newlinechar There are few things more frustrating than to read an argument in this area being made on small samples and specific examples.

&gt; Yep mostly because people know they cannot use C++ for text processing. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, a large part of my recent project did involve string processing. The project was basically a database and search engine, both the data import (which involved parsing an ad-hoc text format and outputting XML), indexing (for full-text search, plus word stemming) and just parsing the user-entered search query involved fairly major string processing. Boost was a lifesaver here, I used both boost::xpressive and the string algorithms library extensively. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, some of this could have been done in a 'better' language, like Perl, but it certainly wasn't difficult to do it in C++.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The major problem is copying. newlinechar  newlinechar * Copying is actually fairly infrequent, lots of parameters of type `const string&amp;` in my code. newlinechar  newlinechar * Even when a copy is taking place, most strings are small (a few hundred characters), so even a heap copy is pretty quick. (I did have a few 'large' strings in my application, e.g. I read in a ~400kb text file, but these are never copied.) newlinechar  newlinechar If the copying characteristics of strings is having a major impact on your application's performance, then there is probably something else wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar When I mentioned performance swings, I wasn't specifically talking about strings. However, in languages with immutable strings, you do end up giving the GC a lot of work if you attempt any sting processing. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Boost makes your programs and your compiler messages unreadable newlinechar  newlinechar My program is perfectly readable, I've never seen any boost syntax look particularly ugly, maybe you're thinking of MFC ;) although, if you're used to 'C/C++' with its `RANDOM_CAPITALIZATION` and `wrdHungarian wrdNotation`, I can understand why 'modern C++' with `lower_case` and `template&lt;typename T&gt;` might seem unfamiliar. newlinechar  newlinechar As for error messages, the readability of errors in code using templates is a weakness of C++. The 'concepts' feature in the next version of the standard goes a long way towards fixing this. newlinechar  newlinechar However, in my experiance, it doesn't take long to learn how to extract the useful information from those messages, recognising the full forms of types like std::string and std::vector. newlinechar  newlinechar As for alternative libraries, there are of course things that boost and the standard library don't do, like databases, high-level networking, cryptography, etc. These are things that are well beyond the scope of boost and the standard library. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I have stayed away from Qt, since it has many 'artifacts' due to its age (it predates standard C++, so things like use of namespaces, the existence of QString, QVector, etc. and the use of macros where templates may be better are examples). newlinechar  newlinechar Poco looks better though, I will keep it in mind for future projects.

You are right, it just seems to me that Republicans want to control whether or not we can get an abortion, get married if we are gay, can get affordable health care, or alternative energy etc. They do promote the freedom to carry a gun though and also the freedom to kill a fag or nigger w/o being charged with a hate crime. newlinechar  newlinechar The Democrats seem to want to promote our freedom to get an abortion if we choose to do so, get married if we are gay, to get affordable health care if we are sick &amp; find alternatives to our oil dependence.

No one explained it?  Does the reviewer need someone to hold his hand while he buys something? newlinechar  newlinechar It's right there in the product description!  And even so, it's pretty self-explanatory on the front of the book where it says 'Garfield **Minus** Garfield', with Garfield being erased by a pencil eraser.  The commenter is just trolling. newlinechar  newlinechar Try going to the product page and looking at the product description (emphasis mine): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In an act that should qualify him for the brilliant editors hall of fame, Dan Walsh discovered that **if all traces of Jim Davis's lazy, lasagna-scarfing cat were expunged from his own comic strip**, Garfield became a funnier, much darker series, about a desperately lonely, self-loathing man's existential despair. Walsh started posting his altered strips at garfieldminusgarfield.net. And in an act that definitely qualifies him for the good sport hall of fame, Davis not only didn't sue him but approved of the project. **This collection of the best de-Garfielded strips prints Walsh's altered cartoons next to Davis's originals;** Davis even throws in a couple dozen Garfield-minus-Garfield strips he's done himself. Interestingly, Davis's stabs at the concept are mostly just gags about Garfield's owner, Jon Arbuckle. The gist of Walsh's approach, on the other hand, is to completely alter Davis's jokes—a strip in which Garfield displays a single hair, announces this is all I'll be shedding today and marches off before Jon delivers a punch line, after Walsh gets through with it, becomes two panels of Jon silently glancing around before haplessly declaring, I dread tomorrow. If Samuel Beckett had been a strip cartoonist, he might've produced something like this. (Nov.) newlinechar Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Come savor the existential adventures of Jon Arbuckle in Garfield Minus Garfield. Based on the phenomenon ignited by Dan Walsh’s hilarious and wildly popular webcomic (beloved by The New York Times and The Washington Post, and hailed as “inspired” by Garfield creator Jim Davis), Garfield Minus Garfield **takes everyone’s favorite fat cat out of the picture, leaving us with only the lonely ennui of Jon as he’s left to voice thoughts about his own existence into an empty void.**
OP said, and I quote: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; the only people you will see creating music are those who can afford to dedicate their time and resources into it newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You cited Bach as a counterexample.

&gt;I can't help but think the international community is saying to Israel 'if you're not ok with a two-state solution we have an option you're going to hate even more.' newlinechar  newlinechar Except that Israel *is* OK with the two-state solution.  Every time negotiations have been done it's the Palestinian Arabs who end them, usually with a final demand that Israel could not meet and remain Israel or with terrorism.  The current Israeli government and body politic have gotten cynical about the two-state solution because few in the world, even in America anymore, seem to think Israel has any right to a state of its own.  People, especially like you, seem to think that dissolving Israel is A-OK if it means that the 'conflict' (more like the unilateral refusal by the Palestinian Arabs to let Israel exist coupled with small-scale land-theft by the settlers) ends. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not.  This conflict began because Arabs could not accept the right of Israel to exist as an independent Jewish state, and quite frankly I and most other Jews see no reason we should give up our home to end that.  That's not negotiation, that's not peace, it's just acquiescence to what our political enemies want.

I get what you're saying, but I wonder whether a school should allow a student to continue in a professional program if they know she'll never become a 'qualified counselor.'

If so, then why let her continue her degree and loose an unethical counselor into the world?

And yet we did. And that is the fault of George Bush, Dick Cheney and everyone down the chain of command. newlinechar  newlinechar Congress screws up a lot, but they got it right this time. And yet the executive branch went on ahead doing what they wanted to, because of the power of the signing statement. This is part of Arlen Specter's really persuasive [argument](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22656#fn12) that we need to get rid of signing statements.

That's broken window fallacy thinking. Military production is not an efficient use of resources, if they are not needed, at least. If it weren't for military spending, those resources (physical, labor, and others) could be directed to new innovation. Often in economics, people confuse the map for the territory. newlinechar  newlinechar Keynesian ideas of stimulation rely on people's expectations of expenditure and consumption. Nothing that Keynes wrote says that a large, standing military (as a percent of GDP) is beneficial to the economy, although he would say that a large INCREASE in military expenditure would be beneficial during times of economic recession.

From seeing my parents who were married very young and still happily married, as well as my own romantic experience, there seem to be two fundamental things: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. You have to want the same things. newlinechar 2. You have to know how to fight. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want kids and she doesn't, or if you want a quiet life and she doesn't, or if you want the freedom one day to sell everything and backpack through Nepal and she doesn't... Well, that will put a strain on things.  You're looking for someone who's traveling along a similar path, in the same direction as you.  And you just want to travel together. newlinechar  newlinechar And, everyone fights.  So, you have to learn how to fight constructively and come to positive resolutions together as a team.  Finding that way to work with each other will be key for when things aren't going so well because that time will come inevitably, unfortunate though it may be. newlinechar  newlinechar The third thing, which is unlisted, is really Law 0, and is crucial to relationships of all kinds, not just romantic ones: You can't communicate too much.  You cannot communicate too much.  You might be able to talk too much or expect too much, but it seems most fights are from misunderstanding and miscommunication.  The answer is to be proactive in preempting that with lots and lots and lots of communication.  Learn to love talking about everything.  :)

I'm not blaming anyone for unknown unknowns. Can you look me straight in the face and maintain that uneducated people are not aware that there is such a thing as 'education' and that it's purpose is to make people more informed?

In and of itself this doesn't require any particular education, this only requires honesty with oneself. Too many people in the world, educated and uneducated, don't even have that. This is a character and personality flaw that very easily develops into full-blown neurosis, and from there has the potential to become something more pathological. In layman's terms, it's _crazy_.

Well, it isn't. The only other example I've seen is the state machine example, but as has been pointed out, that's easily implemented using manual trampolining. newlinechar  newlinechar As for writing programs in continuation passing style (which is what the article seems to be talking about) that's just not something that anyone does on a large scale. You only need TR if significant portions of your program are written in CPS, not if you just have an occasional function which takes a continuation argument. newlinechar  newlinechar In a language like Python, tail recursion is a much lower level construct than the looping and iteration primitives the language already provides. There's really very little reason to include it in the language. It wouldn't do any harm, but I've never missed it.
Ah, no, I don't believe I said that or anything even resembling that. newlinechar  newlinechar What I said, and I stand by despite any downvoting I've received, is that the author (which I just noticed is you: hi) equating himself with the artists he steals from is egotistical and offensive. The article is full of doublethink, logical fallacies, and just generally stupid arguments. Above them all, being the idea that he understands what it's like for a musician to invest time in their work for no money, because he bangs out some poorly written copy in his spare time. newlinechar  newlinechar The article shows thinking so twisted I couldn't possibly hope to engage in an argument with the author, we simply have no common ground.

True.  I'm always surprised by the 'military creates jobs' argument.  Then why not just put every unemployed person in the military or some pseudo-military type government job?  This is essentially what the USSR did, and of course it didn't work in the long term. newlinechar  newlinechar Expending resources on weapons that are blown up or rust away does nothing to increase the wealth of the overall economy.  If you build tank with your money instead of building a car, you might find yourself without transportation.  Build a cruise missile instead of a TV and you might find yourself without entertainment.   newlinechar  newlinechar But the military provides some economic benefit in that it is a form of insurance.  By protecting the rest of the economy, the military can provide stability that will encourage investment into more civilian activity that provides direct benefit, like building cars or growing food.  (Of course the military must be used prudently for this to work.)  Insurance is a good thing, but it is possible to have more than is needed.  So how much insurance is needed?  It depends upon the risks, and those are hard to measure. newlinechar  newlinechar

It's not nearly as easy as you think. newlinechar  newlinechar Most US IX's handle around 1GB/sec (yes, bytes) during an average weekday.  That means that each IX generates no less than 80TB of data daily. newlinechar  newlinechar The fiber equipment alone to transport that much data on a daily basis from ONE IX, let alone the 4-5 majors, is extremely expensive. Even if you wanted to light dark fiber versus lay your own, it's extremely expensive.   newlinechar  newlinechar Probably the most cost efficient method would be to mine data locally at each major IX.  To do that, you need a LOT of computational power at each location.  On top of the dozens of cabinets, replicating a multi-gigabit optical link is not as easy as switch port replication.  A device capable of keeping up with the signaling alone would probably run 6 figures. newlinechar  newlinechar I suppose my point is that, although you're right about the 100% likelihood that this is going on, it is not a cheap operation by any means.

You're logic is flawed.  How can we presume the Constitution restricts the public from collecting data (especially in light of the 1st amendment)?

What you need to understand is that nothing temporary in this situation. It is like dinosaurs arguing that a meteorite is temporary.  newlinechar  newlinechar What happened is actually very simple: New generation. The republican party as we know it cannot survive anymore. Because of the word 'conservative' slapped to it. That word has no positive meaning to new generation, only to old farts. You cannot sell to new generation idea that some particular social stance is good, because it is old (conservative). Slavery is conservative, oppressing women is conservative, killing gays is conservative, torture is conservative, religion is conservative. All these things are as old as our civilization. newlinechar  newlinechar I think what we are witnessing here is a beginning of the demise of republican party. There are 2 possible ways to future for them.  newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Completely transform, moving very much to the left, dropping 'family values', dropping religion, accepting gays and abortion. Concentrate on small government, personal freedoms, strong support of business.  newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Or they will die and a new party will take their place. newlinechar

Well, as an atheist, I do not believe in Satan either. That being said, not very far at all.  The only way I could see what he said coming from the mouth of an actual Christian would be if he considered being dead and being all to be Hell.  If he was telling him he would not be in God's light, and would be going to this version of Hell. But this negates the demon rape and hellfire and torture... I think he is a jackass who knows enough about scripture to con his congregation out of a fat check every month and thought he was cleverer than Hitchens.  He was angry when he found that he was not up to the task and showed his affinity for another imaginary creature (Satan).

Why is that? 
Yes, a typical argument for our inflationary system that people use is that it 'encourages investment'. newlinechar  newlinechar What they fail to realize (or acknowledge, depending on their education) is that inflationary environments have lots of projects started - but only a portion are ever completed. newlinechar  newlinechar Any project of significance (say 5 - 10 years) will invariably run way over budget and be scaled back significantly from the original plans. newlinechar  newlinechar As these projects get underway, lots of other projects are also underway (and the amount of such projects in the pipeline grows as more inflationary pressure comes to bear). Soon all these projects are competing for a fixed pool of resources - thereby driving prices far higher than originally estimated. newlinechar  newlinechar You can see this clearly in the modern market. There are lots and lots of successfully completed short-term projects (housing, strip-malls, chain restaurants, etc), but far fewer large scale projects. newlinechar  newlinechar Its ironic that Obama is pushing for creating a 'green energy infrastructure' while at the same time enabling a climate of inflation to take hold. The scope of a complete transformation of our energy infrastructure is far too 'big' of a project to ever be completed in our short-term inflationary planning environment. newlinechar  newlinechar 
You're right - I meant the niqab.  Thanks for pointing that out.
I remember learning about how 'I was just following orders' was not a valid excuse when I was a kid. I believed it for a long time, because when people tell you things when you're a kid, you believe them. Now I realize that it's ridiculously simplistic. If you don't follow orders in life, you will quickly be out of a job. If you don't follow orders in war, you may wind up dead and certainly wind up in prison. newlinechar  newlinechar If people spent all their time second guessing their orders, they would have no time to do anything, and no groups could be formed to do anything. newlinechar  newlinechar Disobeying orders and doing the right thing is courageous and heroic. But we shouldn't pretend it's easy to know what's right, or easy to rebuke powerful authority. It's very much open to dispute whether not disobeying orders should be an offense, and it should NOT be open to dispute that being ordered to do something by a powerful authority is a mitigating circumstance.

Yea, the worst part of it is that by adding ethanol to all auto gasoline and not allowing it in aircraft, it forces every piston airplane to burn regular aviation fuel which is still leaded.

Texas usually gets things right when it comes to gun laws.  I also have a concealed weapons Permit in Florida.  If you have a permit you are allowed to use lethal force if you're life is threatened or if someone is committing a forceable felony.

I agree with everything you wrote, however I still think it's more complicated. newlinechar  newlinechar They consented to join the military, which means they consented to being brainwashed and turned into something of an emotionless killing robot.  Nobody was holding a gun to their head when they enlisted. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it gets more complicated still, though, because of social/economic forces which shape that initial decision to enlist.  The current US version of capitalism has put many in a position where enlisting is a very tempting offer.  Social forces from the media to 'patriotic' school textbooks to pledging the flag every day in school all shape a culture where signing up to be brainwashed into an immoral killing machine is celebrated and praised by friends and family. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the education system in the US is partially to blame as well.  These 18 year olds don't know the US' recent imperialistic tendencies and the media doesn't fill in that gap either.  These kids don't know exactly how immoral the history of the US military is, all the way down to the grunts. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: I think the damage to these kids is already done.  I think the solution from here is to speak up honestly about the realities of enlistment, of the US military and about US history.  Enlistment is a very big moral decision and if these kids aren't told the truth by someone, this will continue to happen. newlinechar  newlinechar I recently talked a very smart, left-leaning, college graduate out of enlisting who was totally ready to sign because  of the bad job market.

I'm in CA and I've noticed more trouble than in the past. Similar, but not as bad. Zucchini, about half of them star to rot and die, fall off, at about 2 inches long.

In my city all new neighborhoods are required to have centralized mailboxes. The centralized mailboxes are actually very convenient because they lock and have special compartments for larger parcels.

&gt;Disobeying orders and doing the right thing is courageous and heroic. But we shouldn't pretend it's easy to know what's right, or easy to rebuke powerful authority. newlinechar  newlinechar In this case it was easy to know what's right. It was a direct order to torture someone. And as for resisting unlawful commands, it would be interesting to know how many military personnel were prosecuted for refusing to comply with an order to torture a detainee. I suspect that the number is very close to zero. newlinechar  newlinechar That's an indication that there is a very deep problem with the military in this case. And with the CIA, we have an even worse problem. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I recall that in the UCMJ, it is an obligation to disobey, and to report the issuance of, an unlawful order.
Agreed on the girl. It's not always the case. Girls seem to have that 'it's real not because of logic, but because of feelings' thing more often than guys. So if you're going to get debattacked it's more probable from a girl. But it is often borderline flirting. One of the more freaky of those I've seen was in the bbc documentary on the phelps clan, where one of the daughters seemed to be combining flirting and telling the guy interviewing her that he was going to hell.

I always found it interesting because the early Christians, back when they lived in Rome, were often accused of being atheists.

My main point is that the unemployment statistics aren't clear cut.  People should neither except the governments headline number (U-3) or the most apocalyptic number (U-6) without knowing what they mean.  There's not really such thing as 'real' unemployment.  The largest component that makes up the difference between U-6 and U-3 are part-time workers. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd like to see an index (U-7 maybe?) which weights part-time workers by the fraction of 40 hours they work.  I wouldn't call this 'real' unemployment either though, it would just be a measurement index.  newlinechar  newlinechar You mentioned the reason why the government doesn't just take # working / # possible workers and call than unemployment.  It would be massively overstated, and count people who don't actually want jobs.

The cockpit doors could be locked even before 9/11.  The problem is that in the past, the hijackers would simply threaten to harm a passenger or a flight attendant, and the cockpit doors would be opened for them. newlinechar  newlinechar Majority of hijackings were resolved on the ground, and it was thought better to cooperate with hijackers in the air to minimize casualties. newlinechar  newlinechar The retrofits after 9/11 were to reinforce the cockpit doors that they could only be unlocked from the inside and would be more resistant to attempts to open them by force. newlinechar  newlinechar However even this is not as secure as you think - the pilots have to get in and out during the flight to use restrooms, etc., and during these times the cockpit is vulnerable.  In fact people raised concerns that if a hijacker managed to gain access to the cockpit and locked the safety door behind him, even air marshals would be unable to get in. newlinechar  newlinechar I think El Al uses a double door system with something like an air-lock area in between, so that only one door is ever opened at a time.  However this is very difficult to retrofit to airplanes that were not designed to accommodate it.

Yes, there's a problem, since in the intro. he explains that his analysis is based on the Vajrayana school, but that he will return to Buddhism as a whole in his conclusion.  But in his conclusion he never ties Buddhism back together.    All the same, the scope is greater thean Vajrayana, since the analysis of the article applies to most Mahayana schools.

Not at all. I am all for a single-payer system in the U.S. in order to provide basic quality care for all. But above that I'd be perfectly fine with the rich buying extras out of their pocket. No problem with that at all. Want 1000 extra cable channels in your room? Sure. Want to pay to have your own private room? No problem, as long as it doesn't take too many rooms from other patients, why not? newlinechar  newlinechar One day I even came up with a way to encourage people, in a single-payer system, to go to the GP and to get regular checkups. Basically people would receive a refund every time they went in to the doctor for a regularly scheduled checkup. The size of the refund would depend on the amount of taxes you paid into the system. Like I said, the refund would be small, maybe $10 bucks for someone in the working class and maybe $40 for someone making over $100,000. But what it is is a small incentive to get people to think about preventative medicine instead of waiting for problems to spiral out of control. And what it does is recognize the larger contribution a more wealthy patient makes into the system. newlinechar  newlinechar I think under a government single-payer system all people should pay into the system, regardless of how little their income, even if it is $10 per week out of their pay check. No free lunch for anybody (unless you're disabled or retired or something). newlinechar  newlinechar Small compromises like these would go a long way, I feel. And after a generation or two, even 'rich' people wouldn't have it any other way (which is of course what Republicans fear).

(sad fact of life for most good restaurants, they dont always last) newlinechar  newlinechar another great place serves uber local fare is called Lilly's (it's on bardstown road about 1 mile south of jack frys)  newlinechar  newlinechar and another fancy schmancy place called Eqquis, i never went there but two of my homeboys worked there and they really knew there shit and were jealous of jack frys, they said they were on par w/ us. the critics and diners didn't agree as overwhelmingly though. newlinechar  newlinechar there's also some fancy places at the hotels downtown (some italian place I forget the name, and the Oak Room at the Brown Hotel) they're both pretty damn good from all i heard, but still hotel joints, e.g. overpriced and not ground breaking by any sense. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar for cheap eats, there's a place called the Gumbo shack that serves gumbo and cajun shit (no muffaletta though =( ) a breakfast place called Toast, and a bunch of other good shit i cant remeber the names of. alot of good cheap to medium priced places on lexington road really. louisville is a great town for local independant eateries.  newlinechar  newlinechar p.s. everyone will tell you to eat at 'Ramsi's cafe on the world' it's cheap, fun, has a huge menu and is always packed, but they cut serious corner in the kitchen, not necessarily with cleanliness, but with general quality/safety issues. (they use too much bleach in their sanitizer because they have so much old fuckin chicken all over the place, they use whatever plastic bags/containers are cheapest, not necessarily food grade plastics and other corner cutting shit) it's like a fuckin assembly line in their prep area and half the line cooks have hepatitis and aren't legally allowed to work in food service. i worked there part time in the morning doin prep for about 6 or 7 shifts total before walking out.

I'm very disappointed in you for deleting your previously posted comment promising upmods for whoever can post a link to the Event Horizon hell scene.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike what [certain nonelected greedy traitors of fundamental democratic ideals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIPO) would like you believe, [quoting a short excerpt of a creative work for purposes of criticism or comment is perfectly legal in the US](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107), and your self-censorship is (a) spineless and (b) part of a worrying trend of chilling effects against free speech. newlinechar  newlinechar But anyway, here's the response I authored after you posted your comment and before you deleted it: newlinechar  newlinechar The words 'event horizon hell' appear to be a popular search on Google Video. However, all actual clips of that specific scene that appear to have been online at YouTube seem to have been taken down from there. So if the [MPAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RICO) eejits weren't so anal in terms of abusing [unconstitutional laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA) to remove even the shortest of excerpts that clearly are fair use, I wouldn't have to resort to posting [a link to the entire movie](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzE2Nzk0MDQ.html) now.
Absolutely. In fact I'm going to get my wife to do it as soon as we get back from our vacation. I'm not saying that waterboarding is not horrible torture, just that everyone can stand 15 fucking seconds without any problems.

Or is it just politically incorrect to call bullshit when it's about torture?

There were no hotels in the 1400s or before. There were inns and, later, hostels (from which the word hotel is derived), maybe a church or monastery. Since the printing press was not re-invented until 1450, illiteracy was about 99.999%. So, no one to SIGN in. Thumbprints? Pointless. If you checked into an inn, all the proprietor cared about was 'can you pay'. Most likely up-front. Alternative, free accommodations: the roadside haystack, barn... no logs there either. newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, travel was limited to those who HAD to hit the 'roads', at their own risk. Highway robbery was a serious get-rich-quick business then. newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly, surnames in the sense as we know them today are an 18th century (I think) idea.  Otherwise you were known as, e.g., osirisx son of (here your father's name), or Lord Whatsisname, both of whom were illiterate, anyway. The origin of many still existing names, such as Macdonald (son of Donald) or Fitzsimmons (son of Simon) were derived either from father's name or tribe/clan's name. Or place of residence: Leonardo di Caprio (L from Capri). newlinechar  newlinechar Although I'm really curious how travellers fared in pre-1400s Far/Middle/Near East.
It's actually a bigger saving that that (assuming a significant number of 15 byte strings).  A million 15 byte strings will actually save you 16 MB (you'd halve the size taken).  When you switch to heap allocation, you can no longer continue to store the first 15 bytes in the header, so you need to include the heap space for those as well (ie 16 byte header + 16 byte heap allocation =32 bytes, vs 16 byte header)  (It's probably slightly higher in fact as there'll be a bit of extra bookkeeping for the malloc as well.) newlinechar

when has any random idiot been given the money, resources, IP, etc that lucas had at his disposal? newlinechar  newlinechar Lucas had a ridiculous amount of resources to work with. Practically infinite resources - money to hire the best script writers in the world, the best directors, actors, CGI people.. he could have hired armies of script writers to write tens of versions of the plots he wanted and then compared them to one another etc etc newlinechar  newlinechar Lucas has infinite resources but he decided to just shit out a garbage screenplay and throw it on-screen with some half-baked sequences that came up with over the course of half an hour daydreaming at his cottage. newlinechar  newlinechar Lucas's recent movies are all exercises in egomania, not works of art.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you watch the behind-the-scenes stuff for the prequels for instance you discover that Lucas surrounded himself with a bunch of brown nosing yes-men. Everytime someone questioned the judgment of Lucas he would explode on them and often fire them or demote them. The ones who stuck around were terrified of stepping on his toes or even slightly criticising his ideas.  newlinechar  newlinechar The same thing happened with teh actors - most of the actors have talked about what it was like on set and it was basically all lucas's fault. Portman, Vader, Ewan, Samuel Jackson, etc are all actually really good actors but the young actors especially would be sabotaged by Lucas' terrible directing. For instance Lucas would tell them to NOT use contractions.. WTF? But of course they cant really control it so at some times their dialog is jerky and non-contracted 'I do not like this' instead of 'I don't like this' etc. What's funny though is that lots of contractions go through anyway. Lucas was apparently always telling them to repress themselves and to look like they were constipated, repressed, and awkward. Basically, he took these actors who have all made really great performances in other movies, and totally fucked them over and prevented them from doing what actors do best. newlinechar  newlinechar He's an egomaniac run wild unwilling to take the advice of anyone. Hence, you get shit movies. Surprise surprise. newlinechar  newlinechar Any idiot could make better movies cause any idiot would not be as much of a control freak as Lucas. All you have to do is use the millions of dollars of expertise of the very well-paid professionals around you and you'll instantly have a better movie.

 newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; here is already a europe-wide socialist system. I have a european health card, which means I can get free healthcare in any european country, we can get our pensions and benefits paid in any country regardless of where  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Forgive me, I am not that familiar with these matters. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Is the pensions and health benefits for someone from say Norway the same as for someone from Poland or Romania? Are the benefits the same? Are UK tax funding social programs in say Poland? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Our average incomes aren't that much less than the US newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It is still a fairly large difference. Here are the GDP (PPP) for the 4 large economies in Europe (according to the world bank). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 6  United States 46,859  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 18  United Kingdom 36,523  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 21  Germany 35,442  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 23  France 34,208  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 27  Italy 30,581  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar $10,000-$15,000 dollars is quite a bit (IMHO).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But it is not only that which I am talking about – it is the fact that there aren't that many people truly succeeding in life. In a socialised world, it is as if your decisions doesn't really matter. There are no people truly succeeding or failing.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In many countries, you have to work extremely hard to succeed – and competition to get ahead is immense. Maybe that is also a reason why the USA's university system is so much better – because people truly compete (if you compare economy size, Germany and France's university system is not that good when compared to the USA). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 'a lot of european guys go to other countries to live and work' This is because we like to see the world and experience other cultures. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe. I just don't know why there are so many people from Europe you can shake a stick at. A lot of those people permanently life in other countries. Maybe it is just the weather. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, these are just some thoughts open to debate. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Just another thought. People act as if income inequality is the problem. I don't think it is - poverty is the true problem. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar People can be rich while there are still a high income inequality (for example, half the population earns $100,000, the other half earns $1,000,000). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In a globalised world, people's salary will tend to be near each other globally. I doubt that it would be bad for a poor country to have 40,000 rich engineers.

For the record, there were deaths associated with GBS in the 1976 - upper estimates do state upto 25 deaths were temporally linked to vaccination. newlinechar  newlinechar What Bedrovelsen is ignoring is the fact that 1976 was the only year that association between the vaccine and GBS has been found.  And all other batches of the vaccine have been fine.  This is especially important for the flu vaccine because its prepared afresh every year based on the current variants of the virus that are around.  Also, the probability of developing GBS is roughly one in a million even in the 1976 vaccine.  Compared to a historical mortality rate of 1-25 deaths per 1000 infections for flu pandemics.  So yes, there was one 'bad' vaccine in all these years but each flu pandemic or epidemic has been worse than that.

The US likes free trade deals with other countries, but in reality when it comes to agriculture they are as bad as, or perhaps even worse, than the Europeans. Free market rhetoric seems to come from the US as long as it benefits them, but should it benefit another country then all of a sudden Adam Smiths 'invisible hand' is not so relevant anymore.

There's certainly precedent for this sort of approach: in many jurisdictions, you may not legally practise a profession such as law, accounting, medicine or engineering without suitable qualification. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, in some respects, this can be a good thing. As long as the system of qualification is credible and the cost of becoming qualified is proportionate to the benefits, regulation is an effective way to stop con artists from taking over. newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is, in a field such as medicine or engineering, it's pretty clear who's right and who's wrong on the basics. We have many generations of experience to draw upon, and objective measures of success. After all, it's not like you can argue that someone dead survived or a collapsed bridge is still standing. This gives a certain credibility to established professionals with a track record, and makes it reasonable for professional bodies composed of such people to formally recognise ability and experience in others through peer review. newlinechar  newlinechar But in software development, there is little doubt that the industry is still in its infancy. No-one really has a solution to make everyday software secure and reliable with minimal costs in time and money. Many best practices are built on faith and propagated by dogma. There certainly are people who really do know how to write very high quality software with near-zero bug rates, but the approaches they take are staggeringly expensive and would never be viable in their current form for most software development that requires reasonable but not perfect quality. In this environment, who is qualified to judge the abilities of others? The answer, I expect, would rapidly become 'those with enough money', and this will remain the case until our industry has developed more objective measures of success and more reliable means to meet them, such as are used in true engineering fields today.

I think the major problem is that for general purpose, reusable code, it actually takes *prescience* to make ideal APIs. newlinechar  newlinechar If nothing else, the more an API is customised in *appropriate* ways to match the code that will be using it, the cleaner that integration can be, but the more an API is customised in *inappropriate* ways, the harder the integration becomes. It follows that if you don't know ahead of time what the calling code will need to do, you can't know how to specialise your interface but a generalised interface will inevitably be suboptimal for that particular context. newlinechar  newlinechar Sometimes, software development is just hard to get right. :-)

You are correct.

I was puzzled by this somewhat. I began to wonder if your thinking was along these lines: John Stuart Mill talked about the living truth versus dead dogma. Living truth had to be reasoned out from the alternatives, but should the alternatives wither away and die then even a thing that was a living truth could become a dead dogma that is believed because of lack of alternatives rather than a rigorous understanding of why it must be true. Do you want to reach for religion or supernaturalism as an everlasting, poor alternative to naturalism that would keep naturalism a vital, living truth rather than a dead dogma?  newlinechar   newlinechar &gt; Best regards,  newlinechar   newlinechar &gt; Shane Celis   newlinechar  newlinechar Hitchens wrote back a single sentence. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  You guessed right.

I don't know what math background you already have but see my reply to shinynew. Linear Algebra by Hoffman and Kunze is a great book for really learning the subject from a mathematicians perspective rather than the boring engineering perspective they usually give in school. I strongly recommend checking out the Stanford Machine Learning [course page](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/). newlinechar  newlinechar For beginner programming, the best book I've seen is Head First Java. Also, the main Python tutorial online is good and free. Project Euler online has great problems that combine math and programming challenges. newlinechar  newlinechar In general, you can usually find a university course page that contains a lesson plan, lectures and homeworks for whatever you're interested in learning (MIT opencourseware is great but you can also just use google to find one). Amazon is also useful for finding a good textbook, just make sure you read between the lines of the reviewers (watch out for whiners and people a little too excited about the book). newlinechar  newlinechar Whatever you start with, make sure you ALWAYS WORK THE PROBLEMS. Otherwise you really won't learn anything, especially in math.

Having traveled to different parts of the world (mostly Asia), the image that Christians have created for themselves isn't nearly as bad.

However it will not be in the West- it will be going back home to the middle east, as well as become a major religion in places such as India and China (it already is huge in Korea).  newlinechar  newlinechar Evangelicalism is already lost- the 'culture wars' are over and Christianity in the US has suffered greatly because of it.

The stupid!  It burns!  Also, you **would** think that icy cold polar waters would harbor lots of life.  This is because there's lots of wind at these latitudes which drives oceanic upwelling.  When the wind blows the right direction, nutrients are pulled to the surface after having spent centuries at the bottom of the ocean.  This is why humpbacks feed in polar regions, and give birth near the equator, where there are very few predators. newlinechar  newlinechar Equatorial waters have plenty of solar energy, but very little nutrients, and comparatively little biomass.  This is because there is little wind.  Most of the air moves straight up, with the water vapor that we'll later know as rain.
I find Erlang pretty easy to read, but Haskell is still tough for me. I guess as mentioned a few comments down the associativity and precedence just needs to be second nature and then it gets easier.

How many do you think have starved because of the capitalist mode of distribution (and no, you aren't allowed to say that when people starve in a capitalist system its due to natural phenomena but in a communist system the blame lies directly with Marx)?
You're right, it is a waiting game. newlinechar  newlinechar The 'System Update Button' only works when you have already been prompted for the update, but you clicked 'Update Later,' rather than 'Ok.'
&gt;What is important though: Russia provoked the conflict itself, Georgia foolishly acted upon it. newlinechar  newlinechar Ummmm... you clearly have been drinking the propaganda kool-aid. It is *very* clear that Georgia started the conflict. Since you're in need of a history lesson, I'll oblige, but only briefly. newlinechar  newlinechar Georgia and the rebellious S. Ossetians have been fighting back and forth since SO's assertion of independence. Small attacks and skirmishes were sporadic. Russian peace-keepers were sent there to prevent either side from doing anything really stupid, but they didn't have to worry much about the SO militias. Georgia's president, thinking that he could get into NATO faster if he was engaged in combat with Russia, decided to set the whole thing in motion. He built up his forces, which the SO's and Russians saw happening. The SO's tried a preemptive strike but failed to do anything. Then, Georgia launched their assault, kicking it off with a huge artillery barrage of SO's capital, reportedly killing thousands of civilians (obvious outcome, must have been deliberate). Georgian forces also attacked said peace-keepers and easily advanced into SO. What they *didn't* know was just how prepared Russia was to intervene. Russian forces came down and basically obliterated Georgia's entire military. How they didn't see that coming is a testament to Sakhashvili's idiocy. Russia played it perfectly.  newlinechar  newlinechar Why does any of this even matter? Because the US never quit playing the Cold War game. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US has been able to expand their empire into East Europe. They have also been expanding NATO into former Soviet territories in an effort to encircle Russia and dominate them. That's why we supplied and trained the Georgian military. That's why Russia took the opportunity to crush Georgia. Basically they just won the most recent battle of the ongoing Cold War and showed American client states that they are not safe just because they're American client states.
&gt;It is still a fairly large difference. Here are the GDP (PPP) for the 4 large economies in Europe (...) $10,000-$15,000 dollars is quite a bit (IMHO). newlinechar  newlinechar It is indeed! But in real life, the [difference in productivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita_per_hour) isn't very big. Here are the GDP(PPP)/hour of the same countries you listed: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;2 	United States 35.90 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;4 	France 35.09 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;9 	United Kingdom 31.27 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;14 	Germany 29.69 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;15 	Italy 29.22 newlinechar  newlinechar As you can see here, a French worker and an American worker contribute about **the same** to GDP per hour. The French just prefer to go on vacation while the Americans prefer to work extra. You cannot say that the American system produces better workers, it just indoctrinates people into working more hours. The French have the same opportunity to obtain monetary wealth as the Americans, but people _choose_ to work less; in effect, **'buying'** time off (+ the French actually have the choice because of their labour laws). In my opinion, it's all in how you measure these things. newlinechar  newlinechar Which leads me to my next point: GDP is not the end all measure of prosperity; it's an _indicator_ of prosperity. The USA is highly commercialised compared to many European countries, so more purchases take place, inflating the GDP. For example: Italian stay-home mamas doing housework don't earn a salary, yet they produce services. American nannies doing the same work would be paid for it, though, thus visibly contributing to the economy. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you couple this with the [income inequality of European countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality), you can actually construct an argument of sorts implying that most Europeans are generally materially and opportunity-wise _better_ off than their counterparts across the Atlantic. newlinechar  newlinechar **Food for thought!** Anyway, I liked your post and I'm not necessarily completely disagreeing with you :-)

US - Soviet relations were better, and the fear of a nuclear holocaust was pretty much wound down by the 80's, though not entirely. We were worried about Soviet hegemony increasing around the world, but less worried about an out and out war. It was seen that the paradigm would be small to medium size 'proxy wars', like Vietnam and Afghanistan.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest thing that happened to corporate culture was Ronald Regan and his restructuring of taxes and promotion of greed. Peoples expectations rose to ridiculous levels. There was a celebration of obcene wealth. The middle became irrelevant.

Snowfall is not sea ice. newlinechar  newlinechar You just changed tack yet again. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Clearly this is not a sign of increasing warming. newlinechar  newlinechar Clearly. The temperature measurements are though. And funnily, they show warming. newlinechar  newlinechar Sea ice is a very complex system - to say 'there's more, ergo it is colder' is simplistic in the extreme. It's like saying 'the sun is shining, ergo it must be warmer than a cloudy day' - something a simple thermometer will tell you is regularly false. newlinechar  newlinechar Why use indirect evidence you clearly don't understand (you didn't even specify if you meant extent or volume), when the direct evidence is available? Unless (shock horror) you're pushing an agenda, and are blatantly ignoring anything that doesn't fit.

&gt;A system-wide salt doesn't do anything useful for added security newlinechar  newlinechar I beg to differ.  Even if I only use a global salt I have just nullified any plain vanilla rainbow table you might have - you would have to build a new rainbow table from scratch.  Also, often the global salt is stored on a different server than the database itself, so even if the database is compromised, figuring out the salt so you can build a new rainbow table isn't going to be feasible. newlinechar  newlinechar Per key salts are obviously better though, since you would need to construct a rainbow table for each password you are trying to crack. newlinechar  newlinechar I personally use both a global and a per key salt in my hashing mechanism.

Alcohol was a large factor in my father's death (he actually shot himself after his kidneys failed) but I would never be for the prohibition of alcohol, drugs, or firearms. newlinechar  newlinechar I believe the first principle we should all try to live by is to 'never initiate violence'. newlinechar  newlinechar As a result, if I cannot convince someone to not use drugs except by resorting to violence (i.e., arresting and jailing him) then I have to leave him up to his own devices.  However, I am also not required to support him if he cannot function.  It may be that he or someone else can convince me to support him but I have no obligation to do so and should not be forced.

Exactly.
That's fair. newlinechar  newlinechar When I wrote my explanation, I assumed that an attacker that had gotten ahold of the password hashes would also have access to the global salt. I realized that calculating a new rainbow table would be somewhat expensive, but still nothing compared to calculating a new one for each user's password. newlinechar  newlinechar If you can make it hard to fetch the global salt, then it's not a really bad way to go, although it would still be a good idea to use individual salts.
I've noticed that the 'after=' has the ID of the last story contained in the value, so it's probably there to make sure that the last story on the previous page doesn't appear at the top of the next page.  This causes errors when the story ordering changes (massive downvotes send the story to the bottom of the queue).  If it just pulled from the 'count=' value, you'd see the same stories a lot because of the constant reshuffling.

If you read the report, Greenwald goes into detail about what this means.

&gt;One of the fundamental tenets of feminist theory is that gender is a consequence of society and culture, not biology. newlinechar &gt;Unfortunately for them (and all of us) the feminist theory that males and females are psychologically identical at birth is wrong. This has been proven by science and by feminists themselves who were disappointed as parents by their inability to gender-bend their own children. newlinechar &gt;There is a component of gender which is due to society and culture, but that difference is built upon a fundamental difference built into our biology and psychology, honed by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree. However, it is 2009 and we have overcome most (not all) of the stereotypes because as human beings we are always 'work in progress'. newlinechar The situation of a woman today is much better in terms of opportunities to advance within our society. What I don't understand is why women say that they want to be treated 'equally' when in practice we can all see they want to be treated the 'same', which is impossible because of biological/psychological differences. Anyone who has female coworkers can attest to this albeit there are exceptions. Sorry, but I can't be politically correct when it comes to the truth. Among many other things, their ability to cope with stress and their decision making abilities under stressful situations is a joke (no offense to women). Of course there is practically an equal number of fields where women are better in doing their job by far, but to women those fields seem very unimportant and low and degrading. newlinechar   newlinechar &gt;This situation is not one of (mis)understanding. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree, politely. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: typos newlinechar  newlinechar

'Don't let a few bad apples ruin the whole barrel.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Here's the problem with that statement, which is correct for traffic stops and the like.

There are countless videos out there where a bad apple cop beats up a guy in a wheelchair, beats the shit out of a girl, etc. and the 'good apple' cops stay silent and do nothing to stop the abuse.

I really like Florida. I grew up down south and go to school in the northern part so I've experienced the two halves.

You have to be an easy going person to survive down here. If you try to fight it you will go nuts in the process, which is how most people get this way in the first place.
They can compromise users of their own application, with a one way hash not even the lead developer would be able to easily get a lost password. newlinechar  newlinechar Typically these systems mail you a new password, and you need to log in and change it, since they can't mail you the old password since it's irretrievable. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: On his ethical concern, a one way hash can make the password irretrievable, but there is a time when the company has your password and it's not hashed, and almost anyone could log those secretly. Then with name/email/password they could get into your gmail/facebook whatever else you use that password on. newlinechar

Did I say I thought there were no possible objections to this argument? I haven't said anything at all about the argument except that I thought subscribers to this subreddit might find it interesting (which I did by posting it). My previous reply was merely a question; I did not say anyone who read the article must agree, I honestly wanted to know what *you* found lacking. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I found this argument particularly interesting because it doesn't limit itself to the Christian god like a lot of arguments; I think most people (aside from pantheists) who accept a god would probably agree with the definition in the argument.

Well, I think I was kind of going after the notion that some people are annoying prima donnas and that some people just like to shit on others 'cause they don't know exactly what they do.   newlinechar  newlinechar So I'm anti-shitting, how's that?   newlinechar  newlinechar I think the way you deal with someone who is junior to you is to be very patient.  If you can't be patient, maybe you're not smart enough to work with people who aren't as skilled as you.  **A smart person can work with other smart people, but a real genius can work with anyone.**  It takes patience, honesty, pointing out errors &amp; being on guard for them, making the improvements about the code and not about publicly destroying someone's ego.  Surprising but true, it's not impossible to teach people something without making them feel like shit afterwards. newlinechar  newlinechar But as the leader, you're responsible.  So... if you think you don't have time to wait for junior developers or if you can't absorb the risk that they'll make errors, you have to do the work yourself.  But this can't be a long-term solution.  It makes the junior people dislike you because they think they're getting stuck on shit work detail.  It makes you resent the junior developers 'cause you have extra work to do. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, it comes down to the fact that training requires patience and time, direction and vigilance.  If you can't do that, you shouldn't be sitting in the big chair.  It's a pathetic cop out for the team lead to shit on his juniors for a project failure.

Let's say that I am a system administrator at some company using one-way hashes for its users' passwords, or that I otherwise have widespread access to the various systems there, and that I want to start collecting the users' passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar Although I *could* try attacking the hashes, I'm a sysadmin, thus I'm lazy. newlinechar  newlinechar First, I could run a tcpdump on the server's external network interface, collect traffic on the appropriate port, do some magic with awk and grep, etc. If we're not doing ssl, ssh, or some other form of secure traffic, then that'll work just fine -- I'll be able to grab all the passwords I want. newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, as part of my work, I do a variation on this fairly often to recover passwords for users who have forgotten them, in cases where some particular program still knows the password but stores it 'securely'. All I have to do is trap the password at its most insecure point -- on the wire in this case. newlinechar  newlinechar But let's say that I work at one of the few organizations that has considered this, and so we use ssl/ssh. Now what? newlinechar  newlinechar Well, let's say we've got a web application running php/MySQL/the usual. The passwords are stored in the MySQL database as one-way hashes, and the traffic on the wire is encrypted. So instead I'll just edit the code for the authenticating php to dump the inbound passwords to a file on the server. Et voila. And, again, as part of my work, I have done precisely this on two separate occasions in order to determine which Joomla account a hacker had compromised (lordy I hate Joomla). newlinechar  newlinechar My point was, if I have privileged access to the system, then it doesn't matter how many barriers we toss in my way: at some step, the password must be handled in clear text, and that's the step I'll attack. newlinechar  newlinechar Hell, I could even go to some extreme lengths and compile a new kernel if I want, or start searching through system memory, or whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar Password security is in place mostly to make it harder for unprivileged (or under-privileged) persons to attack passwords. That's why I made the comment about implicitly trusting the individuals running the site, and why I still don't understand the ethical part of the objection to storing passwords in plain text.

Interesting counter argument! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The difference in productivity between the USA and UK/Italy is however still fairly large (almost 20%). Also, the people in the USA are not forced to work more. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; (+ the French actually have the choice because of their labour laws).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The labour laws are pretty bad for French business (including small business). They have a saying about that: hiring someone is worse than marrying someone. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The USA is also full of smaller businesses (contrary to popular belief). It would be interesting to see what the number of small business owners per capita is when France is compared with the USA. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There is still another problem I have  – people in Europe are less likely to change jobs or to quit and enter the labour force at a later time (e.g. to raise children or care for an elderly person). Because of the more restrictive laws in Europe, voluntary job mobility is lower than in the USA. It would be interesting to see a statistical comparison between the two. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; For example: Italian stay-home mamas doing housework don't earn a salary, yet they produce services.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That may be true – but it would be reflected in the spending patterns of the money earner (the creation of wealth would somehow reflect in the GDP). A bigger problem for Italy (specifically) and for Europe in general is its population collapse. To say it simply: Italian stay-home mamas aren't producing children. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It is easy to dismiss a population decline with saying there are already too much people. But an ageing and a declining population can have catastrophic economic and social effects. A newsweek article of a few years ago said a contributing factor is specifically on the difficulty of women to re-enter the labour market after having a child (can't find it now – here is another one related to the topic: http://www.newsweek.com/id/47915). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Now, if you couple this with the income inequality of European countries, you can actually construct an argument of sorts implying that most Europeans are generally materially and opportunity-wise better off than their counterparts across the Atlantic. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It would be interesting to see the income inequality normalized w.r.t. the GDP per capita (since that of the US is higher). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The comparison (IMHO) between Europe and the USA is difficult and complicated. No doubt the USA can be improved (less defence spending and subsidies) but just throwing the USA system into the water (as some suggest) and adopting a European one can't be a good thing. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Anywayz, interesting post.

All of us have anecdotal evidence that some of us know not to use to jump to conclusions.  For instance, vitamin C has actually been tested and shown not to work in preventing the common cold.  I may be wrong but doplease show me a blinded study that shows that honey and lemon prevents the flu. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, nowhere in my comment did I suggest that alternative medicine does not work. I am sure some of it works.  Unfortunately, since its practitioners are rather reticent about doing double blind trials, it is difficult to distinguish between effective treatment and mere placebo effects.  In many cases where it has been tried it has not produced a positive result for example, in the case of acupuncture, etc.  However, it does not mean that allof it is crap, it just means that you should only use stuff that actually works both in traditional and modern medicine. newlinechar  newlinechar In line with it, the reason why active components from traditional remedies end up being patented by pharma companies is because they actually take the trouble to test these components and demonstrate their efficacy and lack of toxicity, etc.  It is an unfortunate situation and I am not sure which side deserves a greater share of the monetary benefit but this could be largely solved if the people who use traditional medicine acted with a little more foresight and actually performed blinded trials for the stuff they claim. newlinechar  newlinechar Please re-read your original comment, you were the one referring to a treatment ('if you have the sniffles') and you yourself initiated the silliness about using penicillin for a viral illness, I merely responded in kind. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, in re-reading your original comment I realized that you are not really aware of the scientific data to back much of what you have written so feel free to ignore this comment if you are not comfortable with actual data. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Considering the numerous deaths and horrific after effects of too many vaccinations newlinechar  newlinechar Severe side-effects in vaccination are in the order of 1 in 100,000 or 1,000,000 (deaths are fewer still).  No one denies the existence of these side-effects they are actually freely published, distributed and typically given by the doctor to the patient at the time of immunization.  However, I hope you realize that this is infinitesimal compared to the millions of lives vaccines have saved over the years.  For instance, [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/health/14vaccine.html) might be an interesting reading if you really wanted to be better informed. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Considering that H1N1 is a concoction of human, avain and porcine viruses (viri?), i.e., produced in a lab newlinechar  newlinechar I am guessing you have little idea how viruses evolve and recombine.  You probably are also not aware that hybrids of two of these combinations e.g. avian-human or swine-human are often seen in the wild.  Also that even before we could engineer viruses in the lab, there was evidence of cross-species movement of viruses - and so you can get infection of a single animal(or human) with multiple types viruses (e.g. a pig could get infected with human and swine flu).  I hope these were the reasons you concluded that this virus was created in a lab and you will now think otherwise.  But for some reason I doubt it.

People's reactions to GW science may be political.  The way people try to get people to accept it or deny it is definitely political.  But the sxcience behind it is not political.  it's observation.  That's it.   newlinechar  newlinechar Calling it 'Climate Change' is a political tactic to get you to understand the problem better, because you are likely to experience it in a way that it messes with weather patterns.  Some places may get colder, others warmer, but overall.... the planet is still warming.  And nobody calling it 'Climate Change' doubts that.  They just want to use a term that's more relevant to your life. newlinechar  newlinechar And if you're wondering about the motives behind those politicizing global warming (on both sides), it doesn't take long to figure these two things out: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Deniers claim there's a conspiracy between all the scientists and Al Gore (seriously) to mess with the economy. newlinechar 2. GW Activists believe what they say (therefore, not really a conspiracy). newlinechar  newlinechar The activists could be wrong about GW, but the deniers spend more time complaining about the activists than actually proving them wrong (because it looks like they can't). newlinechar  newlinechar it's actually quite simple...  like creationism and supply side economics, these people don't believe things that contradict their worldview, no matter how much logic and evidence is available.

A lot longer. I don't know how to impress this upon you, but I can assure you that public librarians aren't worried about losing their jobs anytime soon. Good information, whether in print or in digital format, costs a lot of money to compile, and more money to access.  newlinechar  newlinechar Some of the databases that my library has access to are Encyclopedia Britannica Academic,  a Career Resource File, Health and Wellness Resource Center, a Small Engine Repair Resource Center, as well as many others relating to history, literature, current events, and education. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, you might argue that you can find some of that online, and you're right, you might be able to, but you're probably also neglecting the value of your time in finding that information. If you're looking for a diagram of the specific engine for your motorcycle, and then instructions for how to diagnose the problem you have with it, do you want to spend three hours wading through comments on message boards that may or may not be helpful, or do you want to call the public library and have them fax or email you the information in fifteen minutes? If you're looking for how US presidents felt about slavery, how will you know what to look for? You might be able to figure out what to search for, but if your library has an online encyclopedia that's already done that indexing, why not use that and save a few days research (and get more complete results)? Public libraries also provide education about sources. Librarians can teach you how to figure out if the information that you're looking at is reliable, _before_ you've bought the wrong part. These are really powerful systems, but they cost a lot. Sharing the cost of these kinds of resources is better for everybody.  newlinechar  newlinechar In addition to online resources, there are simply things that are never going to be released online because it is too costly to do so. It would cost more to upload and store that information than it does to simply charge for individual hard copies. This is where archives and inter-library loans come in. If a book is out of print, and you're only going to use it once (or aren't sure that you even need it once) don't assume that finding and buying the book will be easier for you than for libraries.  newlinechar  newlinechar Libraries have an important general education function in the community. They not only offer information sources, but they teach people how to use them, and serve as a hub for community information.  newlinechar  newlinechar I am speaking mainly about public libraries, because that's what I know, but these things are even more relevant to specialized libraries for medicine and industry and government. In a medical library, that four hour search could be the difference between life and death for a patient.  newlinechar  newlinechar Libraries _are_ changing. Librarians have to be  more well-educated about digital media than they had to in 1950. They now offer DVDs, language learning kits, and public internet access. I like to think that the trade-off for having to know all this new stuff is that they don't have to learn how to write in special librarian handwriting anymore. :) Seriously, go to your library.

Sure, I can say that I have not reached the level of altruism I feel my affluence should afford me.

To clear up one point, aluminium is a toxic metal in large quanities, but in the quantities used in vaccines it wouldn't even register - you'd get more from walking barefoot in dirt. newlinechar  newlinechar The objections I hear from the crowd I've spoken to about it are doubtful about the effectiveness of vaccines *at all*. There's a large contingent who think that the child's immune system will be sufficiently strengthened by long-term breast feeding (3 years + in some cases) to make immunisations pointless. They were wholly unaware of the implications to the larger population of the vaccination rate dropping below 'critical mass' levels. newlinechar  newlinechar Your in-laws sound like rational, concerned people, but from my experience they are far from typical of the anti-vaccination crowd, who will latch onto any apocryphal story or anecdote to justify their objects to anything coming out of big pharma. The isolated cases (which still have not been linked to vaccines) are dwarfed by the clear and fatal consequences of insufficient immunisation programmes. While I (and any scientifically-minded person) wouldn't object to further research being done, there is no way in hell that it is worth suspending programmes or risking taking your child out of them based on hearsay.

The significance is that the current rate of extinctions is very high in comparison to all previous extinction events.

&gt;&gt;This idea that religion is off limits in the classroom is doing a real disservice to students that might have the possibility of being freed from their religious ideology. newlinechar  newlinechar This same argument could be used in favor of teaching Christianity in public schools. This is why it's simpler to keep religion out of schools in general. Secular means no religion, period. This includes explicitly teaching kids that a religion is wrong (as opposed to presenting objective facts that implicitly contradict a religion). If we want to enjoy the benefits of a government that's prohibited from speaking out *in favor* of a religion, we have to accept that the state can't speak out *against* religion. newlinechar  newlinechar Keep in mind that this teacher was a representative of the state in this context. If he wants to talk about how stupid religion is outside of the classroom, then the situation is reversed and the first amendment protects his right to do so. Inside the classroom, the first amendment limits his rights, and for good reason.

Food for thought: One problem with AskReddit specifically is that users don't vote nearly as much as they do in other reddits-- they click through to the comments immediately, and click away without giving an up or down vote.

The very things they claim are trade secret are likely the way they deal with assumptions they use to make the device come up with a (theoretically) accurate reading. Individual variations in things like partition ratio and Packed Cell Volume can skew readings. If their algorithm statically assumes a 170lb man with a body temperature of 37c, or extrapolates from that using a flawed formula that skews readings upwards in certain unusual cases, then the only way you'd discover that is with an examination of the code. The requirements of transparent government **demand** access to the source code. newlinechar  newlinechar Look, they have a right to keep their trade secret secret, but I say that if they want to sell evidentiary-grade breathalyzers (or voting machines!) to the government for official use, then they can either release the source code or they can go piss up a fucking rope. They can have their secret-source breathalyzers and try to sell them as fucking party amusements if they want, but it's bloody obvious that 'magic boxes' have no place in the justice system.

I see what you mean. We're not using the same definition of 'information'. To be unambiguous, can we agree on the statement that 'to someone who knows how to read and interpret an analog and a digital display, both provide the same information'? By 'reading and interpreting' I mean being familiar with the conventions by which we measure time and having an understanding of fractions. (Bearing in mind that to understand an analog display, familiarity with arbitrary conventions--e.g. two full cycles of the hour hand per solar day--is also required.) newlinechar  newlinechar The more important point of my previous post was that we're essentially asking whether it's better to represent proportions visually/geometrically or numerically (more abstractly, if you like). And I think this is very much a per-user preference. newlinechar  newlinechar Whether or not future generations will prefer a visual/geometric approach to representating time has more to do, I think, with this kind of preference than with measures of information associated with the representations. (Because those future generations able to make the choice properly will of course be familiar with the conventions necessary to read them.)

It's really a piss poor rationalization. Knowledge never has and never will take away someone's free choice. I don't even know how that would work. Besides that, the Bible has plenty of examples of people with knowledge and evidence that God exists, and choosing not to worship him. One of my favorite stories from the Bible, just because it's so absurd, is in Exodus. The Israelites had come out of Egypt where God caused all kinds of plagues and killed the first born of all the Egyptians, God parts the Red Sea for them, they're fed every day in the desert by manna from heaven, and as soon as Moses goes up to Mount Sinai to get the ten commandments, the Israelites melt down all the gold to make a golden calf to worship. And not only that, there's Satan. He supposedly had full knowledge of God and chose to rebel.

Indeed, and Murray Rothbard once wrote the following under a pseudonym: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;We must therefore turn to history for enlightenment; here we find that none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the [ahistorical US meaning of the] libertarian position, that even the best of them [the individualists] have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines. Furthermore, we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position [as if we didn't already know that]. We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists [listen up 'anarcho-capitalists'] are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical.

The workloads that tend to work well right now are compute-intensive programs which spend a lot of time in the bytecode interpreter (i.e. arithmetic operations), as opposed to in C (i.e. constructing a huge set from a trivial generator).  This includes micro-benchmarks (hey, you've got to start somewhere!) but also “scientific computing” in general. newlinechar  newlinechar One reason is that we cannot see “through” C, and so these parts of the code do not benefit from caching and specialization.  We're fixing that one bit at a time, either by teaching the engine about what is happening and short-cutting, or by replacing some parts by “pure” implementations.  (Simple example: Array.collect in significantly faster in xtruby1.9 when the default C implementation is replaced by a Ruby one). newlinechar  newlinechar Note that this is quite different from calling into C (for 'leaf' operations) which is quite speedy—much more so than from the interpreter.  Initiatives such as ctypes are helping a lot in that regard, since having a semantic description rather than a PyObject*-based calling convention can eliminate quite a bit of boxing, etc.  We're also really looking forward to “melding” the generated code with libraries such as NumPy, to minimize the overhead of “glue code.”  We can also perform custom integration; i.e. making sure that interaction with C/C++ application objects is optimal in a specific embedding or extension scenario. newlinechar  newlinechar And, of course, we're looking into speeding up the rest of the workloads.  But that won't happen overnight; it's a lot of hard work. The good news is that we can do it one piece at a time, focusing on the pain points people are experiencing, and moving from specialized sectors to more general ones—while keeping the “interpreter” fully functional and compatible with the default implementation. newlinechar  newlinechar What are you currently using Python for? newlinechar

How very meta.
You keep bringing up things that were ambiguous to the original point of argument: 'What if the service has a sane password policy?' newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not interested in amending the hypothetical situation with restrictions that would make it more secure. If you are looking for the most secure possible way to handle passwords, yes, a one-way hash is going to be involved. newlinechar  newlinechar And I refuse to argue that point in any sense. I don't want my views to be painted in any light that they are not. If I dignify it with an argument, the assumption would be that I think one-way hashes are stupid or pointless or fundamentally insecure. That's not what I think. One-way hashes are the shit. They're great. I love them. newlinechar  newlinechar I just take issue with the idea that a one-way hash is all you need and that it would still protect users' privacy if both the database and application code are compromised. It's certainly a more secure path than encryption. But just because it's more secure does not mean I feel comfortable calling any and all implementations that incorporate a one-way hash 'secure.' The point is that there are clear instances where it's not. newlinechar  newlinechar If I'm capable of running an offline dictionary attack to successfully obtain some users' passwords, I would not call that secure. And I believe your average programmer does not realize that their implementation of the one-way hash as a way of storing passwords is probably vulnerable to this. newlinechar  newlinechar And sure, a dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack. You win there. It's still clearly more effective than a normal brute force attack on a large number of users.

And for fish you can make some great traps in streams just using some sticks, search on-line or read a good survival guide but basically its things like making a reverse funnel with some chum for bait that they can swim in but not out.  Funny anecdote a buddy showed me this plant, can't remember its name but I can recoginize it in a heart beat, that has a sap which is safe for humans but causes paralysis in fish.

I prefer to think of confidence as being *comfortable with who you are*. It probably implies as much an 'accepting' of yourself as it does a 'liking' of your good points. So to be comfortable, it helps to accept your faults as well. For example, if you are the sort of person who is highly creative, but messy when you are, then accept both those aspects of yourself and be comfortable with them. Does that make sense? In this way, it doesn't take anything away from enjoying the nice things about being you, but allows a little room for imperfection. newlinechar  newlinechar You know, it can be very hard to remain comfortable with who we are, because we are bombarded with messages about self-improvement. Most of it comes from the media and business. Whole business empires feed very profitably off making us uncomfortable about ourselves! (how can I go out in shorts when I've got this cellulite?? My car isn't sexy, so therefore neither am I. The people next door look better than me because you can see their plasma TV through the front window. I feel bad and need a Mars Bar and a tub of ice-cream - return to start, re the cellulite). It's all around us, and we buy into it over and over. Very, very clever!  They knock the edges of our confidence all the time by making us uncomfortable about ourselves. newlinechar  newlinechar Ok, so this could be as much a whinge about society as it is an attempt to reply to your situation, but I hope there's something useful in it.  Your confidence will grow not only by liking the things you do, and gaining satisfaction from your achievements, but also by allowing yourself to be yourself. What, specifically, can you think of that currently makes you uncomfortable about yourself? Can you share it? Maybe we can put it into a new perspective for you.

many things will depend on your location. you might need to water it more, put it in a greenhouse, etc. the best way is to find a strain that grows locally, find a strain that you like the taste of, or both if you're lucky. newlinechar  newlinechar cuttings are more reliable than seeds, as they will be a clone for whatever plant you take it from. a little rooting powder, potting soil(transfer to more accurate soil later, your first goal is roots), and correct watering, and you'll soon have a little tea plant. single cuttings might die, but if you get 6-12, some will definitely root. newlinechar

There will always be someone who's better than you or me. Some people just blow me away - how can *anyone* be that good??? newlinechar  newlinechar I think there exists a certain personality type in the world that inadvertently makes us all feel flawed. They are the Olympic medal winners, the concert pianists and the business tycoons. They are the impossible 'perfection' that we can't attain.  We look at them and think 'I could have done something like that, but I'm too lazy/stupid/missed my chance'. The trouble is, we don't have their personality type. To be *that* good, you need innate talent *and* a very very specific type of drive. It's not a matter of being inferior if we don't have that drive - it is a personality type like all the others, and it comes at the expense of many other things that we might take for granted. Let's celebrate being more rounded, more of a generalist, more willing to take different paths in life as they appear in front of us. You sound like the sort of person who might be talented in a number of areas - that's good, because I think flexibility is going to become more and more useful as the world changes so rapidly. newlinechar  newlinechar How far ahead are you trying to plan right now?

Isn't he a little trooper! Don't his parents care ever so much about him! newlinechar  newlinechar Autism happens in the population just like being born with no legs happens, and it's an unfortunate condition that has probably more than one cause. Many well-meaning and intellectually honest scientists spend time and effort researching the causes, which are difficult to find.

We're still looking into it. We're looking into this gene, we're looking into that hormone. We know a lot more than we once knew, but it's far from knowing the cause, and a lot further from knowing the cure. It will probably take many more years and a lot more money.'

You've demonstrated my point quite nicely with your presumptions as to my meaning.  The word libertarian did not originate with the US political party that now describes itself as such.  Once upon a time in the US, and still today in much of the world, 'libertarian' referred to a set of ideals diametrically opposed to any political parties and, yes, opposed to the idea that once an aggressor was personally restrained you would have any justification in torturing them in order to extract information you want out of them. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure you find such a position untenable at the very least.  It can be very impractical sometimes to hold to the ideals we espouse, and thus many people join you in quickly dropping them whenever they are inconvenient.  This simply goes to demonstrate how far most US libertarians are removed from, or simply reject, the history of the word they now make into a kind of political fetish.

I think the prime motivator for religious dogma, and it is a strong one, is fear. newlinechar  newlinechar I really suspect that people are just too afraid to break away from it and think for themselves.  Religion is all fear based, driving these concepts into your head from the childhood at pain of death and eternal damnation that you HAVE to believe.  For lack of another term, it IS brainwashing. newlinechar  newlinechar I think I would invoke the comparison of how much better my life is in knowing religion is false to anyone that believes it.  Because I was raised to believe in it, and when I did all it gave me was added fear and self loathing for things not working like they said it would.  Miracles don't happen because you ask for them on your knees, your life doesn't get better, success and happiness do not fall into your hands from god.  The only thing that gets those things for you is you.  That is the comparison I would make, but then again, it is very hard to undo that brainwashing.  It takes time and exposure to reality.  For me it was years before I let go of that nonsense and saw it for what it was.

I dunno. For me, 'treat them like values' implies a host of other operations for being able to construct and manipulate them, just as we can construct and manipulate non-functional values. Without closures, thunks, or lambdas, there isn't much manipulation you can do with function pointers. newlinechar  newlinechar In the strictest sense I agree that HOF means 'a function which takes/returns a function'. In practice this is almost invariably mixed with all of lambdas, closures, thunks, and currying under the banner of functional programming. It can be helpful to separate out parts of the functional paradigm, but care must be taken to ensure that the fragment is a meaningful unit within or without the complete paradigm. newlinechar  newlinechar Function pointers by themselves are not, IMO, a meaningful unit for expressing HOFs. Technically they are sufficient for implementing function arguments, but the practice of HOF-programming entails the ability to select functions from a non-finite set (which requires closures, or similar). That is, my definition of 'HOF' is for discussing the use of funargs within the context of the social practice of using them for constructing and organizing programs; it is not a definition for the technical basis of this practice. I don't think the term has any meaning outside of the social context, and so I do not equate the thing itself with its implementation. Those of a different philosophical bent may disagree.

You're only looking at the demand part.  johnbr gave a pretty simple but good example about supply.  If specialization exists (and it does) then different groups will be more effective at producing individual goods, and the total utility of the group is optimized by specialized groups manufacturing one thing, and trading with each other to get their needs.  This is basically how our economy runs now; most people have a single job, which pays them money, which they use to exchange for the variety of needs they have.  That's trade.

what res-ident self-proclaimed anarchist-capitalis trolls? newlinechar  newlinechar People are always associating those who riot with 'arachists', which is esactly the *association* techniques the central governments have been using for hundreds of years in order to discredit and ridicule 'anarchists', in addition to polluting the movement with those that occasionally do want to cause mayhem. newlinechar  newlinechar The first anarchist state was that of England with people acting in their own capacity standing in **common law** as the equals to each other before the law. newlinechar  newlinechar This is true anarchy - a generally peaceful distributed society.

&gt; I don't think the explanation you give is really convincing. This what the anti TCO crowd says every time somebody shows an example of where TCO is useful, the response is always oh well I don't see why somebody needs that or I don't see how that's a good example. newlinechar  newlinechar That's right: because nobody HAS provided a good example. The examples have been incredibly weak. One was a tree traversing example that only worked because the tree was unbalanced a predictable amount. The second one can be replaced with five lines of Python code providing a trampoline. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Well, I feel the same way about your stack trace argument, I don't feel it's a convincing example, and I think it's contrived. newlinechar  newlinechar There are several arguments against against TCO and this is actually not the most compelling one, in my opinion. But let's say that the only cost of TCO was the stack traces. Why should we give up ANYTHING at all when nobody has yet presented an example of realistic code that benefited from TCO. newlinechar  newlinechar Are we trying to use the scientific method here, or just going on the basis of arguments of authority? Show us the code! Show us some Python code that is unnecessarily obfuscated because it is working around stack limits. Show us some Scheme code that cannot be transliterated into equally compact or readable Python code. newlinechar  newlinechar Are we going to do this based on facts or insults? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; And features aren't the problem with C++ and Perl, it's the hodgepodge syntax that's the issue. Lisp and Scheme have tons of features, yet the syntax is very regular.  newlinechar  newlinechar No, Scheme does not have lots of feature. The reason that both Scheme and Lisp have communities is because Scheme explicitly rejected the 'piling on features' methodology.  newlinechar  newlinechar From the Scheme standard: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary. Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today.  newlinechar  newlinechar In particular, Scheme has no class/object system. A scheme programmer would say: 'i don't need a class system. I can build one easily if I need one.' I say: 'great'. I love classes and objects in Python. That doesn't mean I feel the need to force them on Scheme programmers. Keeping scheme small is a priority for them, and directly supporting every programming style would prevent that.  newlinechar  newlinechar Please return the favour. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; ... So, really you're just arbitrarily deciding that whatever you like is important for a language, and tough luck for everybody else. newlinechar  newlinechar First: yes, Python programmers choose Python because they share Guido's taste and not Guy Steele's. So it isn't 'tough luck' for those who prefer Guy Steele's vision. Just go use his languages! newlinechar  newlinechar Here's the deep, deep, thing you don't understand. newlinechar  newlinechar There are thousands of languages in large part because different communities value different things. C++ people like C++ pretty much as it is. Perl people like Perl pretty much as it is. All languages need to evolve, but they need to become more what they are, not just randomly copy crap from other languages. newlinechar  newlinechar Python is a language that, among its core values, is: newlinechar  newlinechar  * the language is small newlinechar  newlinechar  * the semantics are relatively simple newlinechar  newlinechar  * the language has several runtimes, some maintained by very small teams, so implementation effort is relevant to language definition newlinechar  newlinechar  * the language is designed to encourage a CONSISTENT programming style so that one Python programmer can read another Python programmer's code easily. newlinechar  newlinechar  * Python is an object oriented language with support for functional programming as an after thought and/or side effect of other design decisions newlinechar  newlinechar Other languages have other priorities and we respect that. Perl programmers love diversity in coding styles: good for them. Lisp programmers also have a high tolerance for diversity of styles: good for them. newlinechar  newlinechar The animosity in this discussion comes from Python programmers wondering why you want to ruin Python by foisting Lisp 'values' onto it. newlinechar  newlinechar As far as I know, you are not a Python programmer, and I would guess that you are not a Python programmer because you don't share our values. That's not to say that your values are lesser: they are just different. newlinechar  newlinechar Now frankly, of all of the stuff from other languages that people would like to shove into Python, TCO is pretty low on the list. Ruby people want us to add blocks. Lisp people want macros and full lambdas. Scheme people want continuations. Java people want static type checking. Smalltalk people want blocks (but more flexible blocks than the Ruby people want). C people want a switch statement. Java people want checked interfaces. newlinechar  newlinechar These are all great ideas. Adding any particular one would not ruin the language. But Python became Python (which is to say a relatively small language) by rejecting extra fluff, and in fact sometimes ripping stuff out after failed experiments. newlinechar  newlinechar Python could add every cool feature that someone likes in some other programming language. But it would not remain Python at the end. newlinechar  newlinechar

I tend to be of the opinion that philosophy, or at least the philosophy of science, needs to be there to criticize (and I mean that in a literal, positive way) the methods of science, as a sort of metascience, and then place the results of scientific observation into a metaphysical framework.  But, that's just that one area, there are many other parts of philosophy.  I just happen to like 'conceptual analysis', but I'm admittedly not a philosopher (studying pure mathematics myself).  I like to think of philosophy as a purely meta-subject.

Then I suppose I am as long as the state is functionally democratic and the population that is represented by that government is not too large.  Historically, socialist societies seem to descend into authoritarianism when exceeding a certain population.  To pull a number out of thin air, I would say that 10 million is approaching the upper limit of what would be feasible, but would be less than ideal at that point.  A population of 150^3 would be perfect :-)

Cars are not nearly as dangerous as the incompetent people handling them. I have speeding tickets, but I have no history of hitting anyone, period. I've never caused an accident. I've been rear ended at a red light and in a drive through, but neither of those instances were my fault, obviously. I have however, thanks to trained reflexes, avoided several potentially deadly accidents: a person switching lanes to where my car was once forced me onto the shoulder. If I hadn't been alert, I would have been struck. There have also been several incidents were people have nearly t-boned me but I either accelerated or braked based on the situation and narrowly escaped. I once hit a patch of ice on the road and had to countersteer properly and regain traction in order to not slide into oncoming traffic. I'm sure there are more that I cannot recall. newlinechar  newlinechar The 55 mph limit was originally instituted during an oil crisis in the heyday of my parents because that speed was the one at which the cars of the day were most fuel efficient. This is no longer the case with fuel efficiency. Speed limits on highways originally had nothing to do with safety, you see.  newlinechar  newlinechar These days, speed limits are primarily intended for taxation purposes. The last time I got a speeding ticket, the cop rattled off the conditions relating to my ticket without a care. He made the whole spiel like an auctioneer and handed me a computer generated print-out bill. If he were concerned with my safety or that of those around me on the road at the speed I was going (81 in a 65), he certainly didn't act like it. That's because what I was doing was not unsafe.  newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, highways without speed limits are some of the safest in the world: I recommend you look up the German Autobahn for an example of this. People who are not encumbered with speed limits will drive as fast as they are comfortable doing, and if they are experienced drivers they will not travel at an unsafe speed for the road conditions. I am skilled at handling vehicles properly: I drive stick shift, and make sure that my vehicles are always properly maintained. Can you say the same?

The only thing I could call a childhood dream would be to make some sort of major, paradigm-shifting scientific discovery like Newton or Einstein. That, or the cliché 'being an astronaut' (but now I'm too tall). I used to have wonder at what science allowed us to discover about the nature of the universe; however, academic research seemed to be all about solving a subproblem of some other obscure problem. It had no connection to nature or higher understanding, and since I am nowhere near the genius of my intellectual heroes, I had given up hope. Academia, to me, was a sentence of publishing and reading uninteresting and mediocre papers. newlinechar  newlinechar I guess that's the problem. The one goal I had blew up in my face, and since then all other goals seem rather arbitrary.

I think you've misunderstood slightly. Roberts doesn't imply that theists dismiss other gods because they are ridiculous, I was merely pointing out that _I_ think it's rather ridiculous to dismiss other gods entirely, without dismissing your own. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem becomes when a theist reasons that, for no other reason, because he believes in God A, then God B does not exist. He probably even knows that the next person will use the exact same reason to dismiss God A, because he believes in God B. Yet the fact that they both use the exact same argument, and they both have the same amount of evidence, that is equally valid in both instances, never dawns on any of them. newlinechar  newlinechar This, to me, is the rare art of using reason and logic to avoid using reason and logic. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It will get nowhere with them, thus making it masturbatory to arrogant atheists (like the ones on Reddit). newlinechar  newlinechar You forget that one of the perks of being an atheist is that we _are_ allowed to masturbate.

Well, the first two points don't address Haskell as a language, but library and naming issues, and you can easily deal with them inside the current Haskell syntax: Redefining (&gt;&gt;=), (.) and ($) is trivial, and an editor with simple refactoring support will be able to re-arrange your code automatically. It's hardly rocket science, but, yes, it hasn't been done, yet. newlinechar  newlinechar The third point can be addressed by providing type signatures for program fragments... I've never looked into it, but I believe such a thing already exists. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And, no, you can't solve Java's problems with an editor, not even with eclipse.

well, to make it easy, a annual increase in consumption of 7% means the quantity used per year will roughly double in 10 years time. I have no numbers for what the rate of change of consumption is, but my guess is it is roughly half that. assuming they did not take in to account the rate of change in consumption, the number is inaccurate. the real number, accounting for the rate of change, would probably be somewhere in the vicinity of 10 years worth, consumption time rate of change factored in. I didn't do any calculations for these numbers, other than i know the 7% increase in ten years doubling is mathematically sound, so don't crucify me if some of them are mildly inaccurate.

Or maybe i would collect my dog shit and make sure to bury it at the root of the tree in your yard, to make even more delicious apples. Gosh this is all getting very complicated. Would you ask me for that apple on the branch in my yard, or should i ask you? I just don't know!

Isreal is Jewish ethno-religious state. Jewish religion mixes these both, so it's also religious issue.  The whole existence of Israel is based on the fact that God has given Land of Israel to Jews.  newlinechar  newlinechar 
Who needs credibility if an argument stands for itself or is backed by a source? Just because it is from a credible source doesn't make it good.
i agree with you, but is displaying a bumper sticker a relevant way of standing up to him? why pick a fight that nobody will notice and that you will certainly lose? newlinechar  newlinechar standing up to authority is important. doing it with passive aggressive bumper stickers is little more than self destructive.
You're absolutely right, the other term that can be used is psychopath. It's more common than you would think. Read this: [http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=936](http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=936)

As with all nasty totalitarian movements there are a lot of hypocritical arseholes who live in a democracy and sympathize with it.

The 'simple refactoring support' will change the source file itself, so again, you have problems communicating with other programmers. newlinechar  newlinechar The Emacs mode for Haskell had some experimental support for type annotations, down on the modeline.  I got all excited about it, then tried it and found it wasn't all that useful, because it never showed me the expression I wanted to typecheck (I think you needed to select the full expression or something).  If it's not instantaneous, it's not really an improvement, though I would really like to see a type-aware IDE for a type-inferencing language.  I switched to vim shortly after anyways. newlinechar  newlinechar And IntelliJ is pretty fricking good.  I've been avoiding Java jobs for the past year and a half, but in every other language I've worked with since (that includes Haskell, C++, JavaScript, ActionScript, Python, and PHP), I've *really* missed IntelliJ's context-aware global refactoring support.  For that matter, most of those languages' IDEs struggle just supporting context-aware autocompletion.
Ditto.
thank you!
I have a dream, that one day, you will be able to find a prostitute in any random city on a street bearing my name..black or white, it does not matter the skin color of your desire!
Well, gee, don't complain about being single if you're not willing to expand your horizons.  
I'll throw my hat in the ring, but dunno if anyone'll catch it. newlinechar Nice to have a team player in the legislature, one who can pitch bills, field questions, and stop short any government corruption.
It is the same, just stale.
I started doing it in stages, 10 to start, then 9-8-7-6... so on until I hit four, got bored, and cranked out some more and called it a warm-up. Couple of weeks into it I continued with 5, rest, 5, and so on, without it being a burpee, just pull-ups. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to work on your pull-ups a bit more though, don't forget the negatives. Jump up, hold, and take up to thirty seconds to lower yourself. Weighted pull-ups are great, too. Cram a 5-10k weight between your legs and go(little enough weight to get 5-10 done). newlinechar  newlinechar Saw [these guys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21dvQyNiTjM&amp;hl) do it too, though I've not had the opportunity to try a muscle-up with it. newlinechar  newlinechar Glad you liked the idea, have fun! :) newlinechar  newlinechar More edit: [Kipping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAZaHzd6qAY), if you're interested to try. Haven't been able to get many of those done yet, working on the technicue/idea.
The company calculated that the cost of disposing / not selling the stuff would cost more than the possible lawsuits.

I hope you're right, and the Internet does hold a lot of promise, it's keeping the guttering flame of rationality alive while society systematically seeks to destroy it, but I hope I don't miss the train entirely.  The only thing likely to bring people back to rational thought is widespread disaster that requires everyone to realize that sloppy thinking kills.  Just a couple hundred years ago, people sought knowledge and were cautious to not trust their emotions unquestioningly because they needed to be right about things in order to remain alive and protect those they cared about.  Now, reason has cast such a wide umbrella protecting so many that those under it are free to avoid doing the work of rational thought with few serious consequences.  People like Jenny McCarthy can run around spewing harmful bullshit about vaccines because she was vaccinated and kept alive with antibiotics and technology designed by rational thinkers.  She had such a charmed life, sheltered from the realities of life, that they do not even occur to her.  I can't imagine such idiocy flourishing 100 years ago when nearly everyone in adulthood would have the memory of showing up for the first day of third grade to find that 25% of their classmates had died of diseases over the summer, and those that remained nearly all had some (now preventable) malady like cleft palate, club foot, blindness from mumps, brain damage from meningitis, etc.  That's just one microscopic example of how society has taken the products of reason for granted and decided to side with idiocy.  I desperately want the death of rationality to not be true, but the evidence is overwhelming.

Thank you! Both me and my roommate always lament how King of the Hill is so often misunderstood by people because it is so ridiculously subtle.  It is and was one of the most intelligent and underrated shows on TV.  A pity it's going away.   newlinechar But even without knowing the characters, I still feel like one should able to appreciate it in large measure.  The way it elevates wholesomeness and small town values is so tongue in cheek sometimes it's hard to miss, especially when it much more obviously ribs liberals and urbanites.
The dictionary entry here is just plain wrong. I've been a working journalist since 1980 (and an unpaid student journalist before then). My career started in the UK.  newlinechar  newlinechar For the last 30 years EVERY newspaper or magazine I've written for has treated companies as singular. I've never known of a competent professional who'd argue otherwise. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't agree with Wikipedia either. newlinechar  newlinechar The Economist Style Guide (1986) agrees with me, so does Harold Evans Newsman's English and Keith Waterhouse's Daily Mirror Style. I may still have some other old newspaper style guides around the house I could check.

Back in California they actually had to make a law that prevented cops from searching your car because you told them that you did not want them to search it. I got pulled over 2 weeks after getting my first car and was asked 'may I search your car'. Saying no to this gave the cop probable cause to search my car. A few months later I found out that they finally made it a law that cops can't ask that question to give them cause to search your car.
I would argue that watching even the crappy 2-5 would be helpful in understanding the important connection between Echo and Boyd. You don't notice how important it is until these last few though. newlinechar  newlinechar I actually might go back and watch them to study Dominic's behavior.

If I go to a new site, I open any links I might want to see in new tabs. I'll have one for reddit, eBay, Flickr, and so on. Sometimes one of these sites will spawn a new search.

No matter what the original intention, your social security number is like your serial number.
