Actually, no, read the links.  The resistance to an infection that’s *already present* can lower with temperature decrease, but if you’re healthy you can only get sick by contamination: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  […] experiments so far have failed to produce evidence that short-term exposure to cold weather or direct chilling increases *susceptibility* to infection […] [my emphasis] newlinechar  newlinechar And no, there aren’t cold viruses everywhere —you have to be in contact with another infected human being to get the virus.  The *sole* reason people get colds more often in winter is because they spend more time indoors, close to other humans, with less airflow.  Also you get the virus through the nose or mouth or eye, not through the feet or exposed arm (washing your hands after spending time with your sneezing friend is [good cold prevention](http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/commonCold/transmission.htm) —wearing warm clothes is entirely unrelated).  There are like half a dozen reliable studies for this cited by that wpedia article alone; if you’re going to contest please provide evidence.
Thanks for asking me politely =) newlinechar  newlinechar As far as anyone knows, this is the one life you get.  Anyone that says they KNOW an afterlife exists is lying or god himself.  I think we can agree on that much... newlinechar  newlinechar Things that are scarce have value, and since my time here on earth is undetermined and very limited that makes me value the time I spend here very much.  As an aside-although an eternal life seems tempting to a mortal, at a deeper level I would find it boring and unfulfilling.  I don't mean to debate you on the existence of an afterlife here, but note that if an infinite afterlife is meaningless to me, than a limited one is definitely meaningful.  That doesn't mean that I want to lose all the time I do have here, but the idea that someday my life will end gives the time that I do spend a value to me.  I can't tell anyone else how to value their life-it would be like me trying to get you to value hockey or gay sex or animal crackers.  All that matters is that it matters to me (life and animal crackers, that is ;) ) newlinechar  newlinechar I love to love, help others (I work in the health care field), I have great family and friends and enjoy all the things out of life that you enjoy on a day to day.  I love to debate and have meaningful conversations and I'm avidly looking for truth and the objective nature of the world we live in, wherever the evidence leads me.  I find it fascinating that everything is the way it is-and we have a pretty good idea how what we see has happened up until the big bang.  As another aside, if god were responsible for creating the sun it would almost take the joy and pleasure out of a sunset.  Sure it's beautiful, but he's god-why isn't it better?  I find life and reality infinitely more beautiful and meaningful than magic or supernatural beings. newlinechar  newlinechar Most atheists don't have any higher reported satisfaction out of life than theists.  So it's not like being an atheist will make you happier but I'm trying to convey it's nearly the same.  We are all humans, first and foremost.

I have to disagree.  If you want to produce Star-Wars quality graphics, and if you want to hire movie stars to do voice-overs, and if you want to hire 20 creative co-directors and 20 managers per programmer to manage your project, then YES, it does cost a lot. newlinechar  newlinechar A good RPG costs more than tetris to make, I agree, but it doesn't cost as much as many companies try to make us believe. newlinechar  newlinechar Shooters are harder to make because the goodness of a shooter comes from some very technically demanding variables.  For example there are no 2D shooters and no turn-based shooters.  So graphics performance is paramount to a shooter, but not as much for an RPG. newlinechar  newlinechar Atlus makes great titles with minimal graphics.  In fact Atlus has a long way to go to match OAngband or to match Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup games.  So there is a lot of head-room still left unexplored for the commercial RPG developers, who still, in all this time, haven't touched the high level of quality of the free RPGs, at least in terms of tactics and player-decisions impacting game play.

Between the bus, the MAX, biking and taking my car on a rare occasion it usually takes me 30 to 40 minutes to get anywhere in Portland.  I lived in the suburbs and now in the NE.  While the roads are confusing at first, Portland is admired for its city planning, and I think the city is laid out just fine.  I find it ironic when cars are stuck behind a biker for miles.  If they were biking to begin with, there would be no problem. newlinechar  newlinechar Portland is a rugged place where people oftentimes fair rough elements, heavy traffic and elevated terrain for the sake of biking.  It's truly something to behold.
I'm sorry, but I think your definitions are a bit messed up.  Atheism isn't not believing in a god, thats being nonreligious.  Atheism is the belief that God does not exist.  Agnosticism is essentially the believe that there is not enough evidence one way or another to determine whether or not a god exists. newlinechar  newlinechar All my statement said was the science, theism, and any other theory NECESSARILY rely on brute facts.  At some point or another, a theory becomes irreducible.  For example, we can explain lightning down to a point until we reach brute facts, where our theory becomes irreducible.  It is just that God, in the case of the theist or deist, is whats called a high order brute fact.  It's far more complex then a scientists brute fact. newlinechar  newlinechar If you don't believe me, please look at some of the brute facts... newlinechar  newlinechar Why do objects have mass? newlinechar  newlinechar Can you explain this in any other way besides 'they just do?' newlinechar  newlinechar We must accept this brute fact on faith.

No. That is an astounding response. It sounds almost like you can feel your brainwaves, or possibly the cerebrospinal fluid oscillating. That second bit may be BS, but I know that there are massage techniques where it is possible to sense an oscillation in the second vertebra (axis) which resonates with similar movements in the sacrum. This style of massage is known as Craniosacral. newlinechar  newlinechar You definitely have a special talent that you should not take for granted. It is possible to cultivate your sensitivity beyond the point you have experienced so far. I believe it may be possible to cultivate awareness down to the cellular level - something I have heard described but never personally experienced. I personally have been able to detect sensations of another person's body (a comment that would typically get me shouted down around here, but what the hell). I have some personal theories about human physiology and energy that I'd be interested in hearing your perspective on.
&gt; There is quite a difference between not giving a fuck and ploughing your car into a group of innocent people. newlinechar  newlinechar Not much.  When you don't give a fuck about something, it really opens up the choices.  For example, if I have some precious vase and I really care about it, a choice to use that vase as a hammer to nail a picture to the wall doesn't even begin to enter my mind.  However, if I don't give a fuck about the vase, I can use it to collect my pee on a hot summer day if I can't make it to the bathroom.  I can use it as a hammer.  I can grind it into powder if I need ceramic powder for any reason.  I can break it and drill the holes in the bits to make for decorations to hang on a Christmas tree, etc.  So basically when you don't care about something, it vastly opens up the choices with regard to that something. newlinechar  newlinechar Now then, if you don't care about some people, and let's say you are angry and want to vent, you can feel free to smash those people.  On the other hand, if you are angry but still care about the people, you will vent by hitting your desk with your fist, or by throwing your computer monitor out the window, or in the worst case scenario, if you don't think of animals as highly as you do of humans, you'll kick your dog.  Of course you can go online and post rants, and you can yell, etc.  But if you care about people, even if you are angry and want to vent, it won't enter your mind to use those people's very bodies, unasked and destructively, as an instrument of your self-expression. newlinechar  newlinechar So, when a man feels like no one in the whole wide world cares about him, and thinks (quite reasonably) it then makes sense to return the favor and to stop caring about others, it really widens the choices.  Many choices that are unacceptable to someone who cares become acceptable to someone who doesn't care. newlinechar  newlinechar I hope I have given you a good explanation.

In other words, if I want to look up a formal definition of the meaning of the comma, I will find something similar to what you describe.  This admission from me should make you more than happy. newlinechar  newlinechar What I am saying though, is that language is not really ruled by formalities in an absolute and/or exclusive fashion.  Language is as informal as it is formal.  Feelings, connotations, context -- these are all important.  What I described is a real-world effect, not some formalized theory.

The courts select people from the general population to serve as jurors on civil and criminal trials.  The pool of people is usually taken from voting records, but also from tax returns, etc.  If you are selected for jury duty, you receive a notice in the mail to show up to a court on a specific date.  Once there, you are screened by the judge and lawyers.  The letter you see was part of a pre-screening process.  People with legitimate excuses, those who have ideological differences, or those that the lawyers don't think will be unbiased jurors are excused from the process.  Otherwise you sit in on a trial, listen to the arguments and testimony, and then come to a verdict with the other jurors.
&gt; Iran also seems to have a more open media as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Not according to the [Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=29031). Iran is ranked 166th out of 173 countries in the latest index; only China, Vietnam, Cuba, Burma, Turkmenistan, North Korea, and Eritrea have less media freedom. newlinechar  newlinechar By comparison, Israel is ranked 46th within its own territory. It does have a problem in the Occupied Territories, where it ranks 149th, but even that's better than Iran. I think it really speaks poorly of Iran that in spite of all the repression involved in Israel's occupation of the Palestinians, Israel still does a better job respecting press freedom in the Palestinian Territories than Iran does in its own territory. newlinechar  newlinechar From the [Reporters Without Borders 2008 Iran Annual Report](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=25431): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Iran’s leaders still accuse the independent media of being in the pay of the United States or the European Union, which has resulted in long prison terms for journalists from a cowed and complicit judiciary. Reporters based in Teheran and Kurdistan were targeted in 2007, with dozens of arrests, convictions and closures of newspapers. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; ... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; More than 50 journalists were prosecuted in 2007 and the independent and opposition media were targets of the usual financial and bureaucratic harassment. The ministry of culture and Islamic guidance, which is responsible for the media, ordered at least four publications to shut down permanently. A dozen papers, including the well-known Shargh and Madaresseh, were temporarily closed pending a court decision and news websites were also targeted. Iran has the biggest number of threatened cyber-dissidents in the Middle East and dozens of websites are shut down each year. newlinechar  newlinechar From the [Reporters Without Borders 2008 Israel Annual Report](http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=25434): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Israeli journalists continue to show their independence of the government, something quite rare in the region. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The Israeli authorities are capable of the worst and the best when it comes to press freedom.

Because it was Ford that said it, not Jefferson.  Several times I have heard people attribute the quote to Jefferson.

This debate came about in the second half of the 20th century as entitlement programs such as social security and welfare were established. newlinechar  newlinechar I think people like to attribute the quote to Jefferson so that it will carry more credibility.  Few people bother to check the facts, and people rarely question a a claim that is aligned with their beliefs. newlinechar  newlinechar If you give it some thought, the quote is really not as profound as it may sound initially.  Any government that has the authority to arrest and incarcerate someone can already 'take away everything you have.'   It really has nothing to do with the size of the government.
Well sure, I agree with both Marx and Rothbard on plenty of things (many of which you mentioned in your post - mostly Marx on class shit and Rothbard on the incompetence of the government).  However despite the insightful analysis, their politics were just terrible - they were both basically just naive statists. I fail to see how agorism is revolutionary in any sense.  Sure, it has the potential to diminish the income of the state to some extent and could complement an actual revolution but I don't think just by depriving the government of some taxes you're going to bring down the armies. newlinechar  newlinechar Also I agree about some system of parecon of social markets.  I think of myself as a really degenerate anarcho-syndicalist that has embraced a lot of mutualist notions about property and has a more laissez-faire approach to currency and labor exchange and what not. newlinechar  newlinechar Though deep down I'm a bright green that thinks someday in the near future we'll have a post-scarcity society and pretty much everything will be automated. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: Like I said, fucking nutty political stances: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There remains, however, the difficult case of children.

But this poses a difficult problem: for when, or in what way, does a growing child acquire his natural right to liberty and self-ownership? Gradually, or all at once? At what age? And what criteria do we set forth for this shift or transition?

I hated Dancer in the Dark.   The musical parts of it were well done and enjoyable, but the tragedy part of it lacked subtlety.   There was no hope, no escape, it made the ending very tedious for me.  I wasn't sad at the end.

And a lot of the times it's records instead of books.

The knowledge that it wasn't the cosmos or Creation that fucked up our world; on the contrary we were gifted with a beautiful one to make of it whatever we *willed*; rather, this widespread state of ignorance and suffering in which we now find ourselves is the cumulative result of unwise and very *human* choices. newlinechar  newlinechar Specifically, we have chosen at almost every turn to submit to fear for our temporal comfort, security, and control when we should instead, like Jesus, have been spreading love with no thought of yesterday or tomorrow. newlinechar  newlinechar But that's just my answer :)

Yeah you're right.  newlinechar  newlinechar To be perfectly clear... hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase are on the virion surface.  HA binds sialic acid which is present on the host cell surface.  After a virion buds neuraminidase cleaves sialic acid so the HA-sialic acid interaction doesn't keep the virus from escaping. newlinechar  newlinechar Is it replication after budding?  Probably not, doesn't really matter.  That's what it does, naming it is semantic.  :)
I'll admit, that pun made me crack a smile. 
The problem is understandable; SF film and television is notoriously expensive to produce and appeals to a relatively limited audience. If *Romantic Comedy 497* tanks, it's not a huge deal because they were able to shoot it quickly and the budget was (relatively) low, the biggest cost probably being the compensation for their big star. On the other hand, if *Star Trek* tanks, that's $150 million down the drain, before marketing and all that jazz. In order for SF to make money, it needs crossover appeal. The easiest way to get that is with recognizable franchises. Add to this that SF seems a *lot* easier to royally fuck up than other genres (that is, there seems a much higher crap to gold ratio than in other genres) and it makes sense that producers would want to hedge their bets.

I once heard Jenine Garafalo talk about fox news 'mock outrage'.

I've heard this argument before, but I don't buy it (no pun intended). You can 'try' music on iTunes. You can 'try' it on Last.fm. I wonder if those pirates who were 10 times more likely to buy music are buying what they've already pirated. Would they be 20 times more likely to buy music if they stopped pirating, or if it was not an option? newlinechar  newlinechar Those who pirate music are likely music fans, so sure they're more likely to buy music. Based on this fact alone, the study seems flawed to me.

You have made some good points and I have voted most of your comments up but I have to take exception with what you are trying to suggest here. newlinechar  newlinechar In short, I think greengordon is right and you are wrong and to greengordon's credit he is not resorting to insults when he has more cause to. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you understand how Capitalism works? Someone with capital invests in something expecting to get back more money then he put in. People with capital that are good at this are rewarded with more capital. Those that aren't loose it. If you don't have capital you don't play. This system is designed for money to concentrate into the hands of those that already have money. newlinechar  newlinechar This is a system based on extraction. Money moving one direction. These kinds of systems are not sustainable. It is like mining, at some point it is no longer cost effective to extract ore from a mine. Taxing the rich and giving some of it back to the middle class slowed the extraction process down. It was sort of like putting some ore back into the mine. newlinechar  newlinechar You are right, stealing money doe not make an economy more prosperous. You however, are worried about the wrong crooks in this case. Capitalists steal the most money. Their profits come from stealing money from labor. When Government taxes the rich is only countering the greatest theft going on in this system.

This is not stressed enough. People always talk about how the healthcare systems were way worse in 1918 so we're less likely to see such a massive death toll, but globalization is a factor that really throws the probabilities in a bad direction. So many people and things are moving all around the world all the time. This virus can now more easily move across the globe, and while it might not be such a big deal when the symptoms are relatively mild, all it takes is one unlucky mutation for it to turn really deadly. Again, with globalization, if such a thing were to happen, the super-deadly strain could infect the world over in less than 48 hours. newlinechar  newlinechar It's been almost 100 years since the last massive flu pandemic and people have been saying that we're overdue.

I thought this question was answered. It is really quite simple and logical. Women have children. Given two employees, one male and one female, both with 20 years experience. The average female will have 2-3 children which means that their career is broken up with 2-3 2 month-12 month breaks. This results in lower pay. newlinechar  newlinechar I would like to see a study on the gender gap in women who do not have children.

Exactly how many database engines do you think Oracle is going to keep lying around and invest in?  newlinechar  newlinechar If Oracle changes the MySQL direction such that the MySQL community is unhappy, they'll probably fork the codebase from the date of acquisition.

No very sick people, even. Everyone has done well from all reports.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's only logical to assume that since the virus everywhere else in the world is genetically identical to the virus in Mexico that only the most severe and untreated cases are being reported there, and we're seeing a tip of the iceberg in terms of number and condition of those infected. This would mean that a large group is infected with a small number of bad cases which end up fatal, not unlike normal seasonal flus.  newlinechar  newlinechar As I mentioned in the headline, unless it mutates, this strain is not something to worry about. Saturday, yes, it was scary. By around Tuesday, it became apparent that what we were seeing in Mexico were an aberrance. With proper treatment, full quick recoveries are the norm.

&gt; So, I have to ask, why aren't you out there making games and showing us all how it's done? newlinechar  newlinechar I keep that in my mind.  I have other interests besides programming and playing games though.  I like working out, so why don't I become a fitness instructor?  I like running, so why don't I run a marathon?  I like contemplation, so why don't I got to some Himalayan cave for 30 years?  All those are good questions. newlinechar  newlinechar My answer is that the world doesn't need a yet another half-assed game developer.  So if I go into the games industry, I better have true passion for some specific game idea, and I better burn brightly with it, or I am an ass like everyone else who just does it for money. newlinechar  newlinechar And my heart is not moved to make games right now.  I like to play them though. :) newlinechar  newlinechar Also, when gamers are desperate, they don't buy randomly.  They buy games that seem the closest to the good game they would really want to buy.  So don't say we are schizo, because we are not.  We are rational to a large degree.  We are, perhaps, not 100% rational, but we are 90% rational.  When I get desperate, I don't buy random crap.  I buy crap that's the next best thing.  Get it? newlinechar  newlinechar Here are the genres I like: newlinechar  newlinechar RPG (best love), Tactical RPG (next best), FPS, Tactical Strategy, MMORPGs, Real Time Strategy, Puzzles, Weird games (games like Katamari go into this category, yea I purchased Katamari with real dollar bills).  That's my list of preferences. newlinechar  newlinechar So if there are NO good RPGs, NO good tactical RPGs, but there is a semi-decent FPS, what will I buy?  I will buy the semi-decent FPS.  That doesn't mean I hate RPGs... it just means there aren't good ones out there but there is a semi-decent FPS.  But what if there are no good FPS at all?  But there is one crappy RPG and one semi-decent MMORPG?  I will then buy the crappy RPG.  Why?  Because I like single-player RPG that much more.  But if there are no good RPGs and there is an excellent MMORPG and nothing else good in between?  What then?  Then I will buy the MMORPG. newlinechar  newlinechar It's rational, but the decision making tree is COMPLEX.  But it's RATIONAL.  It's not schizo.  You just are too ignorant or too arrogant to actually delve into the motivations of gamers.  I guess you think you have us all figured out and you know better.

It may or may not be justifiable (I don't really think that question can be answered a priori), but isn't that exactly the sort of thing that a manager's judgement will get determined by the marketplace on? If the manager is, across the board, paying women less because he assumes they all have children to raise at home, won't high quality employees flock to companies with managers who manage from a more gender-equal assumption-base?  Won't the pay-women-less manager just be missing out on productive workers, and won't the productivity of his company be hurt because of that, relative to that of other companies? newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, if I were the manager, I'd stick with the basics.  I'd ask potential employees about themselves; i.e. how much time they can commit, and I'd hold them to their commitments.  If a woman told me she was more responsible for the children at home, but that she could still do X amount of work, and she did, in fact, do X amount of work, I could really give a fuck less about her children at home, and I would pay her the same as a man doing X amount of work.  newlinechar  newlinechar It gets more complicated because of the simple fact that women get pregnant and men don't.  To be honest, if a manager thinks a woman might get pregnant, I think he (I use he because I'm male) could downgrade her pay knowing that he may not retain her (and productivity is helped by job-continuity).  I would hope he would base this off of studies of how many women get pregnant, at what age, and what this does to their workplace productivity etc...or ask the women if they were going to get pregnant and hold them to what they are saying (abortion is legal) from a loyalty standpoint.  Cold, yes.  Efficiency is deathly cold. newlinechar  newlinechar That's actually why I brought up the discussion about society possibly reimbursing women for their burden of pregnancy-potentiality, and I would possibly be in support of such a plan.  I haven't thought it all through, and the program would have to be really detailed, but it's a possibility. newlinechar  newlinechar I apologize, I think I was making unfair assumptions about what your argument was entailing.  The judgment gets clouded sometimes on these types of issues because I feel as though *intelligent* discourse on this topic is heavily skewed towards cries of *unfair* discrimination.  All managers should be discriminating, as in judgmental of employee productivity, but discriminating on the basis of factors that have nothing to do with the workplace (ethnicity, gender in general) and productivity should be punished by the marketplace, and goal-driven managing should be rewarded by the same. newlinechar  newlinechar *Edit* Mistake on my part, bigtime apologies necessary here.  I wrote a post on the board earlier, prior to responding to yours, which wrote about asymmetry in pregnancy potentiality, not in a response to yours.

I post like 3-5 times a day usually during work.  I guess that makes me a full time troll?  (I'm not subscribed to this /r/ but saw the call out in another thread). newlinechar  newlinechar A few points that some people just do not seem to get.  I don't support Dick Chenys version, Popular mechanics version, the 9/11 commission reports version, George bush's version, or some other oversimplified snap shot of events.  These are all accounts of parts of the narrative, there is so much more than these individual documents show.  People need to consider events on a much larger scale then a handful of sources.  I have come to my current position on 9/11 by reading dozens probably hundreds of sources, watching dozens of internet videos, and talking to probably hundreds of people online.  I read 9/11 blogger, and prison planet and infowars, I could easily start another account and pose as a truther and become your leader. I didn't just read the commission report and say, 'there it is, no more questions here'.  My opinion is dynamic, meaning as new information comes to light it changes.  I used to be a truther. newlinechar  newlinechar A large number of truthers (I dislike that name, but it seems to be the accepted nomenclature) are not receptive to any evidence contrary to their beliefs, and marginalize their opponents (for examples read this posts comments) people literally go though all of my comments and down vote them, not based on their individual merit, but because I wrote them.  A good example is lazyeggs post in this thread.  -5 and its just his story, nothing controversial there, and no one gave a reason why they downvoted him.  its classic group think.  newlinechar  newlinechar THere are literally less than a dozen people in the conspiracy reddit who post againt 9/11 truth, yet every other week there is a call out thread against us. newlinechar    newlinechar Why do I always have to be a troll, a shill, a disinfo agent, an obamabot, a neo con, a sheep, or some other pejorative term.

With gardening, the gardener doesn't make one garden look nice and then charge $50 for distributing a copy of his garden when the cost for him to distribute it is very little. Additionally, in your analogy you described contracting a gardener to do some work and refusing not to pay him. I do not contract a game development company to make me a game and refuse to pay them.
I'm trying to find an equation that fits a graph of velocity, and I have the equation for acceleration.

While at one time I would have agreed with your point, I do no longer. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's why: newlinechar  newlinechar My first site (circa 2000) was a site designed to sell products.  It looked OK and it functioned.  It actually made its first sale within the first 30 minutes it was 'open.' newlinechar  newlinechar But after creating 2,800 static pages over 2 years (I didn't know any other way) I was still making money but any change to the site--like a phone number or address--had to be changed on hundreds of static pages. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason for the specs I gave the developer were to ensure future changes would be simpler and the site would continue to be forward compatible for as long as possible.  In my thinking a site that doesn't validate today is not necessarily going to fit the norms a year or five from now.
The funny thing is, I'm not a big testing guy.  Testing all new code is definitely overkill, even Kent Beck agrees with that. I will test areas that I'm afraid I'll get wrong or write some subtle bug, or that I sense other people might introduce regressions. I'll also test areas that have clear input for given output and -- here's the kicker -- are expected to be relatively over the lifetime of the product.  I'll deliberately not write tests around areas of frequent change because I'll be updating the tests every time the requirements change -- and that's not how tests ought to be. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar TDD doctrine says that writing tests helps direct a clean design, but I never found that to be true for myself.

   For the sake of argument, why would not having a gun make him a 'dipshit?' The man was the very definition of a Romantic; such concerns as safety are secondary to the Romantic's journey, afterthoughts in their minds even. newlinechar  newlinechar    People often slight Christopher McCandless with similar charges (that entering the wild with no survival experience or map was idiotic). McCandless didn't forget such basics becasue he was a dipshit. He did it as a conscientious decision to reject everything he knew in order to start anew. newlinechar  newlinechar    Calling a Romantic an idiot isn't a diservice. Trying to apply common sense to their actions is futile becasue the very tenets of Romanticism are based on the rejection of rationalism.  newlinechar  newlinechar    Then again, I didn't know the man. Maybe he was a 'dipshit.'
I don't know about that. The Republicans are not in control of any branch, and they have recently gotten some very conservative, very *young* judges in the federal courts (at all levels, SCOTUS included). It wouldn't be wise for them to make too big a deal of judicial nominations this early in to the first Democratic presidency in 8 years. If they do, they'll make their party even less appealing than it already is to many Americans because they will seem like poor sports.  newlinechar  newlinechar That's my theory, anyway. We'll see.

short answer: [Google Tech Talk on org mode](http://orgmode.org/GoogleTech.html) newlinechar  newlinechar The meandering answer... I started using org mode about a year ago to **stop losing track** of tasks. Enough failed attempts at mental juggling.

Well, i disagree with you on that point. If a movie is watched, without paying for it, and the person watching had no intention of ever paying for it, how exactly does that hurt the producer of the movie? There was never any chance of the producer making any money off the pirate, so him watching the movie makes no discernible difference on the bottom line. As far as the producer is concerned, the pirate might as well count as someone who hasnt seen a movie. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, considering movie theaters make money by selling seats, it would be wrong for you to let in a friend, as you are depriving the theater of a commodity they sell. If you make a digital copy of a file you are creating a direct clone, where both the orginal owner of the file and you have an exact copy. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, personally, i like going to theaters, and there is no way that i would settle to a CAM or TS of a movie, which i can see in drastically better quality for a paltry sum of about $10. Simply, the pros of seeing the movie in the movie theater over watching a shitty CAM always sway me in the direction of the theater.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That doesnt mean that there arent people who want to watch a CAM because they dont want to pay a single cent for their entertainment, so they get what they paid for, and thats a crummy quality copy of the movie...

One of his suggestions is standardised packaging. An advantage of this, he thinks, would be that smaller distros can 'borrow' packages from larger ones.

&gt;how do YOU know newlinechar  newlinechar Well, I guess it's how I claim to 'know' anything - whether it is a belief that  my senses aren't lying to me, or that the color red really is red and not some other color, or that the Trinity works in XYZ way.   newlinechar  newlinechar I come to accept a certain thing as 'truth'.  I use Nietzsche's model of ReValuation of All Values to constantly throw my beliefs - all of them - in to the fire, and see what comes out.  I do this in many ways, including lots of reflection, and lots of debate.   newlinechar  newlinechar Debate works well.  If I find a greater 'truth', and lose what I originally believed, I'm that much better off.  If I leave the debate finding that I was - thus far- right all along, my belief is that much stronger for it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;how are you sure that's the Christian god newlinechar  newlinechar If you're referring to the verbal description of the trinity, it's quite possible I'm off.  I'm sure of it.  The Trinity is a Mystery of Faith and is not easily understood.   newlinechar  newlinechar But now, if you're speaking about the basics of Nicea, the Apostle's Creed, or the Existence of God, well..I'm as sure it's real more than I'm sure the room I'm sitting in is real.   newlinechar  newlinechar Again, the validity of any truth I claim to carry is repeatedly tested by the ReValuation of all values.

If so, it would behoove the author to _say_ that, rather than expecting that people will assume it. Certainly, it's a possibility, perhaps even a likely one, but it's not something that should go unexamined. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if it's true, it raises other issues - if women can expect a lower pay rate as a result of raising children, does that mean that they should be perpetually entitled to a portion of their husband's income in return? Or should mothers merely accept a lower place in society when a relationship that they've been in for a while falls apart? Maybe something else entirely should be done?
If men can have dependent children without taking the same pay hit that women do, then something is inequal, and this should be investigated. I don't know if the solution to this inequality should take the form of a raise for mothers or not. newlinechar  newlinechar It's possible that the inequality stems solely from the amount of _time_ women tend to spend taking care of their children, however, the article doesn't investigate this at all; it merely states that single women get paid well, ergo no pay gap whatsoever exists.

Very dumb, but extremely accurate.  Not believing in God requires no faith.  It just requires doubt.  Many Christians who denigrate atheists do not understand that we do not replace a faith in God with a faith that God does not exist.

It seems like any rule based system has a problem of infinite regression. You have one set of rules, and then you ask what rules determine that set of rules, ad infinitum. What I wonder is, is this a byproduct of living in a casual universe, or simply a problem with how we perceive the universe casually? I guess I'm piggy-backing another infinite regression problem on to the one mentioned here. Then again, perhaps they are one in the same.  newlinechar  newlinechar In answering my own question, I think there is only one rule set, which we categorize on many different levels so that it appears like many rule sets. The idea  here being that essentially everything boils down to a physics, or quantum-physics rule set. Similarly this debate boils down to the question of a first cause or causes. Perhaps, every perceivable set of causes in the chain of causes is simply part of the completion of the first cause or causes. It's all one big action. We simply cut it up to suit our understanding.

Thank you, so do you.  newlinechar  newlinechar The list of things that people can do to actively combat the flu is short but effective.  newlinechar  newlinechar Wash your hands often. Be conscious of what you touch. Sneeze politely into your elbow, and avoid sick people if possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar As the flu is right now, it requires no special techniques. Despite the misinformation that people have been spreading, if you are in an area with high levels of infection, a mask is 75% more effective than not having one, as long as you dispose of it properly.  newlinechar  newlinechar This isn't a big scary flu any more than any seasonal flu is. It might be later, but it isn't now. Don't be afraid, just use sense and prevent spreading it. That's all I'm advocating. 
If you get a high-end 12TB dual quad-core decked out with the zippiest drives and all the trimmings you can hit $15K for just the box.

There is zero democracy in architecture.  The difference between the way people live and the crap architects want to give them (from low-end carboncopy subdivisions to high-end inhuman sleek unlivable robot buildings) is enormous and ridiculous.

Ender's Game isn't a sociological dissertation or a culture-shifting work of nonfiction. It's a novel. I wasn't terribly impressed with the sequels either, but EG itself stands alone as a good example of accessible fiction dealing with non-mainstream socio-philosophical issues. For what it is, it's quite good. I appreciated 'Forge of God' and 'Anvil of Stars' as more 'mature' works in the same vein - but I'm not comparing them OR Ender's game to 'The Gulag Archipelago'. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's compare apples to apples here. EG has gained widespread acceptance as a young-adult sci-fi novel dealing with complex themes. While it's important to expose people to complicated ideas, their reception of those ideas is largely dependent on the method of presentation. Very few people in my high school classes on the Holocaust took the reading material very seriously until we watched 'mainstream' movies like 'Schindler's List', and later 'The Pianist'. Presentation is everything newlinechar  newlinechar

True. Fusion research has blown a lot of money and not gotten as far as anyone has liked. You are correct. But what does HEP have to offer? It's just a masturbatory exercise for a bunch of physicists who do shit no one else understands because they can. Fusion research is just as hard, just as interesting and could actually benefit society. If it weren't so expensive, I'd be okay with it. When you're gobbling up that much tax money though, you have an obligation to conduct relevant research.

I did some more research. You have to provide either the source or a written offer of the source along with any GPL binary. If a smaller distro *non-commerically* passes along binaries from a larger one, they can just pass along the original distro's offer of source code, according to [this document](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesWrittenOfferValid). So, it appears that you are correct in the case of non-commercial distribution, at least according to my interpretation of what the FSF says. newlinechar  newlinechar Standardising packaging is still a goddamn stupid idea, though. What happens with dependencies if two different distros have different libraries installed, for example? It makes no sense.

&gt;I used to be a truther. newlinechar  newlinechar I am a former truther as well, and can relate to the majority of your post. newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry Cyince, but this next part is kind of directed at HopeForManKind. In another thread where I did not want to go off topic, he asked me a question about my views. I thought a submission was a bit much for someone in my position in this reddit, as all it would get is downmodded into oblivion. I figure at least it's somewhat on topic in this thread... newlinechar  newlinechar ... newlinechar  newlinechar A friend of mine a long time ago introduced me to some videos, and got me into the basics like Loose Change an all that. I felt like my eyes had been opened. The information was so amazing, and unbelievable, and almost numbing at first. Cause I really thought 'this might all be possible'. I believed in it for a couple years, and researched it, but was never really vocal about it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Later on, as the movement spread to places like here, and digg, and infowars/prisonplanet became popular, there was a big shift in thought for me. There came a time where the more vocal truthers got to a point where they couldn't be wrong, and it disgusted me. People predicted the invasion of Iran, governments releasing Bird Flu, and numerous Martial Law dates. Guess what? I lived through them all, because nothing happened. It made me question all of the same people who were 'so sure of everything else'. I mean if they are %100 sure Martial Law was coming, and they had proof the elections were going to be suspended, why did it never happen? If they bring the same passionate argument to me about controlled demo, why should I just accept it without questioning it? newlinechar  newlinechar I became disenchanted with the movement, realizing that I just keep seeing the same plots, the same predictions, and the same old evidence written like its new. First it was just the neo-cons being bad, now it's Obama too. It was bird flu, and now swine flu. Martial law is still imminent, and has been for quite some time. The elections were going to be suspended, all of the guns were supposed to be gone, and I should be in a FEMA camp right now. newlinechar  newlinechar As for the official story, I buy most of it. I believe 3 planes hit the towers and the pentagon. I believe the impacts, the fires, time, and gravity, were responsible for bringing them down. But can I prove the people who hijacked those planes weren't just *allowed* to carry out that mission? Nope. newlinechar  newlinechar My reasoning is, if the government told us 3 planes did what they did, and we all saw it, then that is probably what happened. They have no reason to lie about what we all *saw*. Not because I believe what they tell me, but because that's what happened. It would be far easier for a few of the powerful elite to pay people to have this done, to fund it, to plan it, to *allow* it to happen. That is reasonable, because there wouldn't have to be nearly anyone in on it. When you start talking about missiles, and controlled demo, your bringing in thousands of people to the conspiracy. They could have obtained the exact same results if those building hadn't collapsed. For all we know that was just an added bonus for either the government or terrorists, depending on how you look at it. newlinechar  newlinechar The reason I still read this subr, is because I like to read the information, and there are nuggets of truth that do force myself to reevaluate my stance, and possibly change my opinion.  newlinechar  newlinechar I read this because I am open minded, and I can't claim to be so unless I educate myself with information from the whole spectrum. newlinechar 
Add in the fact that my wife is Chinese and we are atheists and yeah, it did require some major brain cell stomping. The very first night I moved down there a girl at the gas station asked me if I was a yankee or a damn yankee. I asked what the difference was and she said a yankee goes home, a damn yankee is here to stay. I told her that that must have been some of that 'southern hospitality' I'd heard so much about. She wasn't amused.  newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, when it came time to move I drew a line on the map that encircled Dixie and told my wife... anywhere outside this circle is fine. We live in Ohio now (much, much better place).

I can relate. I am a budding woodworker, and a non-affiliated fan of Rockler.

A software licence agreement is not law.

Yep. It's difficult to explain to folks who have not done some basic astronomy readings that the brain forgets every single image at the very same time they are seeing it. When those folks peep inside a telescope for the first time, 90% of people get severely disappointed at what they see. They do expect to see these images produced by a large aperture telescope 'stacking photons' for hours, at the moment their eye meet the eyepiece. newlinechar  newlinechar Another concept which is hard to explain is that telescope don't magnify. Eyepieces do. A telescope job is only to bring the image of an object that is very, very far away on the focal point of the eyepiece. That image is usually millions of time smaller than the real object, in term of linear size, and even the angular size of the object is also reduced by the mirror of a Newtonian or Cassegrain telescope or the first lens of a refracting telescope. The eyepiece is then the device which  magnifies this tiny image produced from the real object... but this image is yet not in focus; it is the very organic lens on the viewer's eye that finally does the job.  newlinechar  newlinechar If a telescope has a large aperture (a large diameter), then it can gather more light in a shorter amount of time. And an image like the one on the left will take about 2 hours to produce with a good 14 inches 'scope on a even more expensive sturdy tripod that won't tremble under the first breeze or the weight shift of that huge piece of optic trying to follow the object in the sky. And don't forget the  expensive achromatic or the more pricey apochromatic filters on the lens in order to capture color differences between stars and nebulae. If one deals with those 500 bucks/4 inches in aperture, this image will take about 5 hours to produce in extremely superb condition on top of a mountain with 5-10% humidity in the air. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and forget about catching with your best 6000 dollars scope that red curvy cloud, shaped like a giant 'S' across Orion. This one was discovered only 5 years ago using adaptive optics. (this is what I am majoring for, btw) If you look at pictures of Orion taken in the 1980s and prior, you can't see it, unless your telescope is no less than 8 meters in diameter, on top of a mountain. newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, this pic on the left was obviously shot at a cost of about 150 000 bucks worth of equipments.

2. I don't think there is an age you can just say and instantly grant the intellectual capacity to give consent. The first thing you need to get into your head is that the only reason a child cannot give consent, legally, is because we decide they can't.  newlinechar  newlinechar No, that's not the only reason children can't give consent - the main reason is because they haven't had the life experience or frankly, the maturation of their brains to be able to decide what is good and bad (left to their own devices, children have &amp; would do ridiculous things).  I thoroughly disagree with the age of criminal responsibility and your justification of children being able to consent to relationships with adults - you suggest taking advantage of someone that (you know) has not fully matured, whose brain is still growing and is not fully experienced enough to know that they are being taken advantage of.

When I was in grade school, my favorite game at recess was run away from the angry black kids.  I had black friends, and my favorite teacher was black, but those assholes were little gangsters in the making. I used to run laughing my ass off as I climbed up and down the playground equipment, man that shit was fun. It was funny, the one time one of them tried to hit me by surprise at lunch one day, only time they ever really got a chance to surprise me, I caught his fist in my hand right before it hit my face.  Made a huge slap in the lunch room, every head turned, and Mrs. Gross, she was the black teacher who taught all my gifted classes and always looked out for me, came over and took him to the principals office.  I really wish I had a picture of his face from that moment, fucking hilarious. newlinechar  newlinechar My older brother didn't enjoy the school as much though, he got caught by 5 wanna be gangsters and beat down. newlinechar  newlinechar Great way for a child to increase his situational awareness which came in handy for sports, and things like never walking into a bathroom while there is only one way out and enemies close are second nature. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm actually glad they tried to bully me.

Please break it up into paragraphs.  You write pretty well, but it's hard to read one giant paragraph. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I spent much of my life as a charismatic Christian but I was too much of a skeptic at heart. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It's a long story, but I just couldn't ever get comfortable with God. There was always something missing. I didn't like how that felt, so I studied everything I could get my hands on in a seemingly desperate hope to prove God existed but always came up short. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; One night in 2002 I was laying awake in bed when it suddenly all came together in one crushing weight of realization. Everything I'd studied all led to the same inescapable conclusion - God didn't exist. The funny thing was it seemed like everybody knew it but they were like me - busy as hell trying to convince themselves God was real. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The hardest part was knowing the truth that we don't live on in any form after we die. I think I got a little depressed for a while about that but I gotta tell you, now that I don't have to worry about God or heaven or sins or any of that crap I feel more free than I ever have in my life. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; All of my judgmental attitudes are gone. No more would I look at someone's misfortune and think to myself, 'If only they were right with God they wouldn't be in that mess.' I stopped giving the empty advice to pray and tithe and actually started helping people. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I began to care about my fellow human again. I realized that the world is what it is, and we are responsible for what we say, what we think, and how we feel. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I didn't have to cry to the heavens, 'Why have you forsaken me!' when something bad happened or praise Jesus for sunny days. The helplessness I felt as a Christian was like a dark cloud over my life. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; All the things I do and experience are not at the whim of some supreme being. I got that good job because of my skills, not because God gave me something. I got in a bad motorcycle accident because I was driving like a jackass, not because God was trying to 'work through me' to help other people. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Well, I could go on and on but suffice it to say it was sudden and exhilarating moment in my life.

Perhaps that is Ford's quote, but there certainly was concern about the size of the federal government during the founding of our country.  If by size we're talking about powers and jurisdiction.

Tests exist primarily to catch bugs.  (Improve design too, but finding bugs is a primary goal).  So what kind of bugs do you write?  If failing to implement parts of the spec is a common failure mode for your team, by all means, write those tests.  But that's usually not a very common thing to do, and anyways you can just tell by visual inspection, did the dev write that code or not?  Especially for central features, those are not going to be missed --  some parts of the product are just so obvious, if you had a bug there it would be noticed right away.  Why put your time and energy there?  With time you can get a sense that some areas are prone to regressions, prone to new bugs popping up -- and those are the areas where you should invest in testing.  At the end of the day, it's all about ROI.

I've often wondered this as well.  In general I believe that the way our eyes function that colors are roughly the same, but of course because there are those who are color blind it becomes apparent that it's very likely that the colors we see may not be exactly the same.  Taken to the most extreme, one could think that it might be possible that what you think is blue is actually green to other people, but because color are just assigned by name you could never really know. newlinechar  newlinechar Though because of how the rods and cones in our eyes function this seems unlikely as they react on the same general wavelength as everyone else, so it's assumed that people are seeing similar colors, but I can't really think of any way to test this =/

First of all...I am working on a video on the failure that is RSA Envision, so I will have a response to this shortly...hopefully next week, but here are the highlights: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) As an asset manager, Envision fails.  It's asset functions store the asset and it does a reasonable job of parsing the XML from the Vulnerability scanner, but I have noticed some high level alerts identified by Nessus, for example what I use, are completely disregarded by Envision. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Envision is not current on the most recent version of Nessus.  It REQUIRES Nessus 3.0.6 and its XML format or you can hang up nessus.  You also need the LINUX version of the old Nessusclient. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) As for this thing called 'correlation'.  I wonder when that is scheduled for deployment.  I cannot find ANY functionality in the product that resembles correlation...or SIEM for that matter either. newlinechar  newlinechar 4) In a nutshell, Envision is NOTHING more than a log collector.  Period.  No more.  It has no SIEM functionality.  It cannot cross reference its own reports since it stores data in tables and it cannot create reports across multiple tables.  So if I wanted to run a report that shows what recent servers were attacked with an known exploit against a recent scan of the same servers, I am shit out of luck.  It simply cannot do it.  A obvious sign of a badly designed application. newlinechar  newlinechar 5) It can do data queries, but it basically the same as the poor reporting. newlinechar  newlinechar 6) Do not try to use this thing to monitor anything in real time.  You specify an actual rule defined in its database.  You cannot fire alerts on keywords.  Again, another feature that should be standard. newlinechar  newlinechar 7) It has an add-on product called Event Explorer.  They changed it from the 3.5/3.7 versions to the current 4.0 version.  I could spend an hour on what a piece of shit this thing is.  Simply put, do not install it.  Learn how to use 'lsdata' instead. newlinechar  newlinechar 8) The product's front end is written in Java and prone to crashing...especially when trying to run 'schedule immediate' reports.  I usually see it crash 2 or 3 times a day. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: I fucking forgot.  You cannot run ANY reports or queries from the command line.  So if you want to run a report for 10 days in a row, you choices are run one report for the entire 10 days or run one report at a time for each day.  Have fun with that and with interface crashing.  God damn I love crashing java interfaces!  Makes my dick hard! Thanks RSA! newlinechar  newlinechar 9) You do get content and vulnerability asset management updates (called VAM) but it does not update the help portion of the product so if you want to make sure you have the latest info on product config, you must use the support site. newlinechar  newlinechar 10) In the 4.0 version, the java problems are far worse than in 3.5.  I think it is memory thrashing problems, but I am not sure. newlinechar  newlinechar 11) Be careful and do not make any changes to the default HTML pages for the reports, unless you want a fucked up report pages. newlinechar  newlinechar 12) More good news.  RSA charges by device and events per second.  So do your math if you decide to buy this thing.  Also, envision is always 'listening' to port 514 so you can have 10 syslog devices (say cisco routers) just pop up one day, eat up your licenses and you'll be scratching your ass wondering what the fuck just happened! [2 calls to RSA to figure out] newlinechar  newlinechar The 13th floor)  The database tables are piss poor as well.  I can see why the developers decided to have set number of tables but when trying to shove 10 different IDS logs into them proved to be too much of a challenge.  We moved from Cisco IDS to Snort when Cisco decided to extort more cash.  Anyway, the first thing I noticed (almost 3 months ago) was no 'high', 'medium', and 'low' for the alerts.  That is kinda sort helpful with dealing with the jackassery known as IDS (another article).  However, RSA was lost as well and I could hear a pin drop when I brought this up.  Kudos to my boss for discovering which field it was in.  1 billion point deduction for RSA. [5 calls to RSA to try and figure this out, Boss figured it out. Yay boss!

I will say a couple of them have been helpful, while two others in particular gave me instructions that forced me to rebuild the entire fucking appliance! newlinechar  newlinechar Cowabunga dog shit! newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, the concept known as SIEM, I am convinced is a worse scam that the Madoff ponzi scheme at this point.  SIEM is a buzzword like Six Sigma and TQM (oh jesus need more booze...I just recalled all that TQM shit I had to do back in the 90s!) newlinechar  newlinechar This thing was called 'network intelligence' back in the day.  If this thing had intelligence, I would not have to write up a submission here on reddit! newlinechar  newlinechar Arcsight is the holy grail of SIEM products.  Just stay away from Cisco Mars.

Systems of checks and balances isn't easy to uphold and defending our freedoms from threats of dark age evangelicals aren't easy choices to make. Preventing fascism from taking power after 911, avoiding draconian laws, and preventing rape of our civil liberties are hard things to do.

Thank you for your attempt of revisionism, do however remember that you will find myriads of books before the 19th century that DID have 'Centralize' as opposed to 'Centralise'  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Some XIX century British census marked many people writing 'Laborer' as opposed to 'Labourer' as their main occupation. newlinechar  newlinechar When people say that Americans changed the spelling it is untrue, Americans kept the 'old' spelling, it is the British who changed it citing an 'Anglo-Norman' influence (that indeed never happened). newlinechar  newlinechar For reference go to Shakespeare's Richard the III and you will 'shockingly' find that the great 'vowel shift' had not occurred. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLong2.aspx?cid=2250 newlinechar

It's *possible*, but it's so speculative it's ludicrous to assert it unsupported in a credible article. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, why would a top-secret military weapon operate on the same frequency/wavelength as domestic garage door openers? newlinechar  newlinechar And how does he know it wasn't just a bunch of kids with a hacked door opener driving around the neighbourhood having fun? newlinechar  newlinechar The difference between a good conspiracy theory and horseshit is that a good conspiracy theory has to be plausible and well-supported by evidence, whereas - to convince some people - horseshit just has to be *possible*. newlinechar  newlinechar Is it *possible* that the plane was knocked out of the sky by a top-secret EM-pulse weapon that happened to operate on the same frequency as several garage door openers in the area?  Yes. newlinechar  newlinechar Given the lack of details on (or even hard evidence of the *existence* of) such a weapon, the lack of evidence it was used in this case, the lack of evidence it was even *possible* for it to interfere with domestic garage door-openers in the way implied and the lack of hard evidence of *any* foul play in Wellstone's death, and given the *known proven* existence of kids, thieves, garage door openers and youthful pranks, is it *probable* that a top-secret experimental plane-downing EM weapon was wheeled out into the countryside to gag one guy, when it could have just as easily been accomplished by bribery, extortion or a 'theft gone wrong' murder scenario?  No - it's completely bloody insane. newlinechar  newlinechar Unless we're drooling, credulous idiots we don't believe things because they're *possible* - we believe them because they're *probable*. newlinechar  newlinechar And this is nothing but a stack of unsupported supposition upon unsupported supposition, backed up by unverified, suggestive *assertions* made exclusively by the author. newlinechar  newlinechar Given the Bush administration and Cheney's well-documented criminality I'm as ready to believe in the possibility of foul play in Wellstone's death as the next guy... but you don't have to invoke secret presidential assassination squads, or top-secret experimental sci-fi weaponry without a shred of evidence to support it to do it. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, it's entirely possible that there was some foul play.  But the author of this article comes off as such a dribbling, irrational retard that anyone who believes him on the strength of it is pretty much beyond hope. &lt;:-/

Arab citizens in Israel (i.e. those that have Israeli citizenship) have full voting rights. There are even Palestinian parties represented in the Knesset (they make up about 20% of the state of Israel's population). Israel offers equal rights to its citizens irrespective of religion, race or sex. The majority of Arab citizens of Israel ([62%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel)) would prefer to remain citizens of Israel instead of becoming citizens of a Palestinian state. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So herein lies the big difference – Apartheid South Africa was based on a minority white control. Israel is a full majority democracy. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So as far as citizens of Israel goes – there is no difference in rights or racial segregation (e.g. duplicate facilities, restriction of movement, pass laws, marriage laws, etc...). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Might not be a convenient truth but that doesn't deter the point from being eligible. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I find that a lot of pretentious people use the word Apartheid in order to sound complicated. The truth is that the word 'Apartheid' only means segregation (i.e. referring to racial segregation). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Israel is a lot more complicated (and unique) than just assigning a simple label on it.

Go back and read your first post. Nobody can read your mind, or see through the computer screen to know anything about your life except what you post. You veer from worrying about choices to suggesting that you want 'traditional roles' to insisting that everything is 50/50 with your partner.  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course these are hard choices. In the US, at least, we have a culture that insists men should have no involvement with their kids besides paying bills and the occasional weekend sports game, and simultaneously tells mothers not to 'let strangers raise their children' but blames them if they don't give 110% at their jobs.
&gt; We can't argue people out of their beliefs. But our arguments can provide the necessary context for people who are already questioning their beliefs. The point is not to convert the blindly religious, because we already know they're not interested. The point is to educate those who are looking for good information about the belief systems they've begun to question. newlinechar  newlinechar This is a good comment and I agree.  Would you also agree that this knife cuts in both directions and acknowledge that there are avenues of philosophy that may be explored in an attempt to discover if there is a greater reality underlying this existence? newlinechar  newlinechar For instance, I am very interested in transhumanism and the techno-singularity.  I find that when I consider these very technical fields in combination with the Simulation argument from Nick Bostrom of Cambridge University, I am left in awe of the unshakable mathematical inevitability that these things will occur, and therefore already have.  This causes me to go full circle and begin to examine religion from a radically different perspective. newlinechar  newlinechar The most intelligent approach to understanding reality is not to deny anything, but rather to embrace all possibilities and open your mind.  If you are scientifically minded, go study quantum mechanics.  If you are technically minded, go study AI and consider the issues I wrote about, above.  If you are philosophically minded, go study the Simulation Argument and other such proofs of 'more'.  And for those that are more spiritual, there are vast oceans of material to study. newlinechar

I think the point is that if it was *that* awful, people would have developed a different language which fixed the problems with it. newlinechar  newlinechar We've built a decentralised, world-spanning computer network since 1974.  An improved querying language for tabular data doesn't seem out of reach by comparison. newlinechar  newlinechar Unless, of course, SQL is actually perfectly adequate for what it's designed to be used for - then there would be no *need* to develop an alternative, so we likely wouldn't have bothered.  Kind of like now. ;-) newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously though - what's so terrible about SQL, and *if* it's so terrible then why haven't we developed a different, better language in the 35+ years since it was first introduced? newlinechar  newlinechar **Edit:** Cleared it up - SQL *as a tool for querying data* is adequately expressive and usable.  SQL *as a language* is excessively verbose and has an inconsistent grammar.  I was assuming functionality was more important than aesthetics or parsability, whereas weavejester was apparently criticising its verbosity and irregularity first, and considering overall utility to be less important.

I'll add you to the waiting list for my autobiography then, if you need my life story to avoid making assumptions well outside the range of a post. I'm sorry to remind you that traditional gender roles are not a synonym for women slaving at home while men frolic freely in the workplace, and that a second income doesn't necessarily mean that is a secondary career. You added the concepts of neglected and overworked wives and absent husbands to what started as a financial contempation. When I didn't include all the details of my life, you assumed that what was left out was the truly pertinant information right from the start.  As you've said, go back and read my first post. newlinechar  newlinechar I am sorry if judgmental and overbearing outsiders 'insisting' on how you raise your kids has been your experience with US culture. It sounds as though your own experiences have made you hostile toward those of us lucky enough to have the choices to worry over. When I consider my future choices, I do worry quite a bit that I will be able to finance them.  But I am realistic enough to know that while all these options are available, taking some of them closes off the others. Staying home reduces my income.  Maintaining my income reduces my time with my children. Trying to do everything reduces the ultimate satisfaction from each, and finding the right balance isn't simple.  You are never going to be able to give 110% at work while giving 110% at home.  Supermom/Superdad is a myth that is strangling our generation. newlinechar  newlinechar My own experience, also in the US, has been much different than what you describe.  In the past year, several of my friends and coworkers have had children.  In one case the couple decided as soon as she became pregnant that she would not work anymore. Her salary was much lower than his and they can afford their lifestyle on his paycheck.  Another couple just had their third child and neither salary alone is sufficient for their household expenses. She's been promoted three times since going back but frequently discusses how much she's missing with her kids. Her husband has a shorter workday, but daycare is the primary caregiver. The third couple, who both work in my field, cultivated a freelance business prior to deciding to have children.  Now he stays home and works freelance and she has a partial work-from-home week at an outside job. But they're both in their late 30s and have found actually having those children to be a challenge. newlinechar  newlinechar But in all of these cases the thing that ultimately made the decision was 'Can we afford this?', with some 'Can we wait until we CAN afford this to do it?' thrown in.

Self-interest _may_ be intensified, yes, but if that is true, we need an explanation for that connection.  newlinechar  newlinechar To me, it seems likely that our assumptions of the abstract Others will be dependent on the stories we are told about these Others. If we are told that we're all egotistical (and we _are_ told that), we're likely to assume that these Others will be too. If this is a likely explanation, then the possibility that if we told people other stories about the Others, that would effect their behaviour, should be kept open.

Surely now, after the financial crisis and the government's having to step in to prop up the banks, banks (especially government-owned ones) should be doing proper assessment of people before they lend money to them? newlinechar  newlinechar For all they know I could have crushing debts!

I think it drives people away as well when peopple put on their stern face and come up with black and white interpretations that have been historically not black and white. newlinechar  newlinechar The New Testament quotes Jesus in such a way that basically the old rules are abolished and the new rules can be boiled down to love God and love your neighbor. I think it was also referenced that the old rules were too hard for people to follow because they had obviously gotten too entangled in *lawyering* about the *rules*. newlinechar  newlinechar Mark 12:28-34 Is probably the best scriptural reference for this.  Not that it's a free pass to go around doing everything you please or anything though. newlinechar  newlinechar If you love God and your neighbor you won't do either of them wrong or you will at least try not to do them wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the same basis why I can't condone condemning someone for their lifestyle whatever it may be. We aren't without sin, our fellow man isn't without sin but we should of course try to live with as few sins as we can.  newlinechar  newlinechar John 15 is another worthwhile read for this concept and actually fleshes out a bit better some of the things I've said. newlinechar  newlinechar I hope my thoughts have been helpful for your question.

The way I see it is kinda like Plato's allegory of the cave.  We are all in this cave because we have not experienced the breaking point in which causes us to sever our political ties with such tyrants.  We only see what we have been brought up to see.  Our founding fathers had to learn that lesson the hard way.  We are leaning on their understanding to prevent having to go through what they did.  Is it so hard to see that they understood something that you obviously don't?  If you get that through your head then finding that something fairly easy.

Good point - it's the difference between 'believing in morality', or 'believing in what you're told by an authority figure', which just *happens* to coincide with defensible morality a lot of the time. newlinechar  newlinechar This also explains the bizarre argument that 'you can't be moral without religious belief'. newlinechar  newlinechar This has always bothered me - it suggests that these people don't believe people (ie, *they*) can rationally consider an issue and decide to act in a moral fashion for its own ends.  Rather, they apparently only behave with morality or empathy because they're afraid of getting spanked by God if they don't. newlinechar  newlinechar This is a profoundly immature and arguably psychopathic mindset - empathy and morality aren't arrived-at from within, but are imposed from without. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly I'm slightly concerned about ever trying to debate religion with such people, for fear of what might happen if you succeeded - rather than creating a more enlightened adult, you might find you've merely taken the brakes off a childish psychopath.

I would love to go back to doing something other than dealing with Nathan's crap but at this point I cannot. In the last twenty-four hours he has posted submissions titled,'What Can Be Done To Curb Government Trolls Like Herkimer &amp; jcm267 in Reddit?' no less than 14 times in various Reddits. He has been posting threads which contain what used to be the IP address of my router. Information provided to him by polymath22. He has down-modded every posting I've made multiple times utilizing his various accounts and made inane and frequently obscene posts regarding me and other Redditors in completely unrelated threads. He has accused me of being everything from a pedophile to being an active participant in mass murder. newlinechar  newlinechar Please remember that the so-called 'Bury Brigade' are not the ones demonstrating this behavior. This is purely on Nathan. I believe that if anyone has demonstrated troll-like, disruptive behavior, it's him. To have him come into a thread like this and accuse others, including you, of being trolls is the epitome of hypocrisy. newlinechar  newlinechar Nathan's problem isn't that he's bothered by all of this, he thrives on negative attention. His problem is that he believes that there should be absolutely no discussion at all on the subject other than everyone marching in lock-step and agreeing with everything he says. He desperately wants to be the internet version of Alex Jones and to accomplish that goal he has adopted many of Jones' tactics. Character assassination, bullying, lying, shouting down his opponents and claiming that every argument except his is simply a strawman argument. He's intellectually dishonest and completely lacking in moral character. newlinechar  newlinechar I would love to get back to what I was doing but I am under attack constantly by one of the biggest trolls to ever hit Reddit. The way he has performed on this thread should clearly demonstrate that he will even attack those that agree with him if he feels that their agreement lacks enough enthusiasm. However, I cannot and will not call for his banning. I believe in the right of free speech and the 1st Amendment would mean nothing if we were unwilling to defend even people like Nathan.

I think both constituencies advocate for their own issue.  Rape can go either way, but I think for men false rape accusations are by far the worst problem.  For women the worst problem is lack of action.  Yet, more action means more false accusations are actually brought to trial, and so we are somewhat at odds.  I doubt anything can be done about it since, as far as I know, anything that reduces false accusations will also reduce reporting.

I think you might be missing my point.   newlinechar  newlinechar Nationalism can do all of the things you're ascribing to religion.  Is nationalism evil?  It may have been used to that end many times in history, but it's also been used for good, at least as often.  It really depends on which people are at the helm of the nation, or the religion, and how they are influencing their followers. newlinechar  newlinechar Suppose Christians were all generally really nice folks, despite certain passages in the bible which could be used to justify killing others.  Then this **one** guy, who has a history of racism, decides to act on his hatred and murder a black family because of a Bible verse.  Would you blame religion for that?  How long do you think it would have taken him to find another justification? newlinechar  newlinechar What's the difference if it's one guy or an entire geographic region?  The core culprits are manipulation and ignorance, not religion. newlinechar  newlinechar As the world becomes more integrated and nations communicate more freely, religions (like like nationalism) will be forced to change- religions will have to learn how to deal with the presence of other religions in a peaceful manner.  Likewise, countries will have to learn to take pride in themselves without insulting the rest of the world.  Otherwise they might drag the rest of the world down with them.

('course, let's not rule out the possibility that I might just be easy). Here's what you need to know: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) You are going to drink a lot of coffee over the next little while newlinechar  newlinechar and  newlinechar  newlinechar 2) You are going to have to talk to her about something other than the fact that you think she's pretty. And you cannot do that in a one-day, uber-condensed chat. If you try, it will probably come off as 'I like your boobies, so please briefly summarize your personality for me. You see, I wish to bang you, but first must evaluate your ability to carry on a conversation after sex'.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you tell her she's pretty and then ask her out, where is the benefit for her? YOU find her attractive, YOU want to get to know her better and it sounds like you have very little rapport so far. Why would she be motivated to go on a date with you? newlinechar  newlinechar Here is what you do (and I promise not to make 'ferocious man-raptor' remarks): newlinechar  newlinechar Over the next 1 week to a couple months (1-2 weeks is good), you're going to go to Borders and get a coffee a couple of times a week. Ideally, you'll do this at odd hours so there isn't a big line-up behind you. Each time you go, you must talk to her about 1 thing besides your coffee order. You can ask how her weekend was (or ask if she's doing anything fun for the weekend if it's a Friday. But don't ask her out. Whatever she says she's doing, just sound interested, make a mental note and move on). You can compliment her on something she is wearing, but try to make it something less sexual (hair, glasses) and avoid the overt (cleavage). The best way to work your 1 Thing into conversation is to casually start telling her about something cool in your life. Make it sound intriguing. newlinechar  newlinechar Examples: newlinechar  newlinechar Girl: Hi, may I take your order? newlinechar You: Hey, how's it going?  newlinechar Girl: *shrugs* newlinechar You: I'm just getting a big coffee today. I'm soooo freaking tired. I really shouldn't have gone to see [wildly cool show] last night when I had to work today, but man, was it ever worth it! newlinechar Girl: //asks you something about the concert/the band/etc// newlinechar  newlinechar There you go.

(perhaps you could let her know when you hear about the next one. Does she hate it? What kind of music does she listen to?   newlinechar  newlinechar You can do this with anything. The key is to actually have something to talk about and it has to sound funny or interesting. If you're stuck, bring the book you're reading and talk to her about it. ('Nabokov's amazing, but I'm finding this sooo hard to get through!') Don't ramble, just draw her into your 30 second anecdote &amp; see if she bites. If she tells you anything about herself, make a note and be engaged in the conversation. Then drop it, grab your coffee and you're done. newlinechar  newlinechar The next time you go, follow up on your previous conversation. Mention something she told you about herself the last time. If she told you she is taking a flower-arranging course, ask her how it's going. Or tell her you though of a band that she'll just HAVE to listen to, now that you know what she's into. At some point when you're having a good chat, you're going to say something like 'hey, I don't think I actually know your name! I'm Ballsofpoop, btw'  Remember her name. newlinechar  newlinechar That's ALL you need. Do this a few times. Wash, rinse, repeat. When you feel like you have a good rapport, tell her about something fun you're doing and if she sounds interested, invite her to come along. xvs' line about going for coffee somewhere is is perfect too. newlinechar  newlinechar Best of luck, dude.

I'm in the legal profession, thank you, and in a particularly male-dominated area of the field where being aggressive is a minimum job skill. It is not simply a matter of acting like a man and thus being treated equally, I assure you. newlinechar  newlinechar My mother, like your friend, was also in the legal profession. She, too, refused to 'present herself as a victim'. She worked twice as hard to be thought half as good without acting as though she noticed. She never complained about the blatant and obvious discrimination around her - I'm talking about things like senior partners announcing to the staff 'No broad is going to be partner if I can help it'. And while she certainly was more successful than if she'd collapsed into a puddle of tears, that *didn't* make the discrimination and unfairness magically evaporate.  newlinechar  newlinechar You conflate recognizing that discrimination exists with 'presenting as a victim' and 'viewing yourself as a victim' (those are two different things, btw). And those obstacles do not go away if we refuse to pretend they exist; in fact, we reinforce them, because those who put up the obstacles point to us as counter-examples. Tokenism is one form of this.

Being falsely accused of rape.   newlinechar  newlinechar To make a long story short, we were both drinking, she begged me to spend the night with her and we ended up having sex.  She couldn't remember it the next morning and after all the hype from the university about 'the definition of rape,' she reported it to the police.   newlinechar  newlinechar Let me tell you, I've never been in a worse place in all my life.  I immediately sought the help of a lawyer (best $300 I've spent in my life) who told me that I could never speak of the incident to anyone.  As the accused you don't get a counselor, you don't get sympathetic friends to talk to, you can't defend yourself against anything anyone says and trust me, the people in the legal system don't really care if you get timely updates.  I went in to the police station for my interview, asked for a lawyer and the questioning was over.  3 months later I found out from my lawyer that the DA had decided not to pursue the case.  Of course this was all part of the way the system works, I was informed by my lawyer to expect the DA to sit on it for a while just to make my life hell whether or not they had evidence. newlinechar  newlinechar And then we get to go to the university system.  First of all, you are explicitly forbidden from bringing a lawyer to the meetings.  And remember the part about not talking to anyone about it? So here is a synopsis of the meeting: 'Well I can't talk about it as I have been advised by my lawyer to never speak of the events of that night to anyone besides a lawyer, counselor, or priest.  All I can say is that I did not rape her.' Well in a system based on a preponderance of evidence I didn't exactly have much of a chance.  I just took the deal where I didn't admit guilt but was suspended from the university for a year.  At least I got my token win - the university agreed that without a conviction, she would be disciplined if she decided to start any rapist rumors. newlinechar  newlinechar And there you have it.  My deepest, darkest moment that I've spent years burying.  I just thought I'd dig it up so you can all take a look at what a false rape accusation is like.

Here's a question:  If you were a terrorist, why would you want to crash into the outside when everyone knows more important shit is toward the interior?  And by the way, why wasn't there a plane found at all?  Why did the lease of the WTC change hands two weeks before the attacks, into the hands of a billionaire private investor who then immediately has a huge insurance policy drawn up that granted him 5 billion in profit?  How does two planes cause three buildings to fall in the same exact manner?  Wouldn't there be, you know, some fucking variation of fire caused one collapse and planes caused the other two?  If the composition of jet-fuel is pretty much equivalent to kerosene, shouldn't the grill of a barbecue pit collapse if kerosene was poured into the fire for a long enough period of time?

Do you *ever* experience attraction to a woman in the same way that you are attracted to children? newlinechar  newlinechar Some women carry less of a burden of pain than others -- they are less angry/bitchy. I'm wondering if it is this attribute that attracts you to children (who, being younger, have suffered less, and are more trusting and curious). If it is, then hope is not lost if you can find the right woman. newlinechar  newlinechar Btw, I think it's possible to dissipate sexual feelings w/o suppression or masturbation, by generating inner body awareness.  newlinechar  newlinechar IMO no kind of sex can provide lasting satisfaction, only an imperfect kind of relief (which becomes more and more short-lived as awareness grows).

Home loan interest (mortgages or equity lines) are deductible up to a total of $100,000, or the whole amount if used to purchase the house or to add value to the house (such as remodeling or an addition). newlinechar  newlinechar So, if you buy a house for $200k, it increases in value to $300k, and you do a cashout refinance for $240k, only the interest on the amount of the original mortgage is deductible.

&gt; SQL has an incredibly verbose syntax newlinechar &gt; SQL syntax is massively redundant newlinechar  newlinechar So does Java.  This is more a personal dislike than a valid criticism of the engineering behind SQL. newlinechar  newlinechar The *single* most important feature of a language is expressiveness, not brevity. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally I hate Java for it's verbose syntax, but I can't claim that personal dislike is an ''objective fault'' on Java's part. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd rather write code in Perl than Java, but that doesn't make Java a bad language, because you're assessing the wrong thing - like criticising a car model for the colours it's available in, rather than its fuel efficiency, handling or safety features. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Hard to create temporary views. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, this is an opportunity for syntax optimisation rather than a crippling fault with the language. newlinechar  newlinechar And it's likely largely because **SQL is not a programming language** - it's a query language. newlinechar  newlinechar A major idea behind SQL and relational databases is to *specifically avoid* creating intermediary structures, as they're usually a waste of time and memory, and complicate optimisation. newlinechar  newlinechar The idea behind a query language is that you model the data properly in the database, then query the data - if you have to use SQL to assemble your data into a usable form before you can query it, you've probably fucked up your database design at the start. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously your example was trivial, but it could be simply and more efficiently re-written as: newlinechar  newlinechar     SELECT student_name FROM students newlinechar     INNER JOIN subjects ON subjects.student_id = students.student_id newlinechar     WHERE subject_name = 'History' newlinechar  newlinechar This query would then be optimised and cached by the database *for* you, without the developer having to bother about it.  Moreover the database can use *real-world* usage data about incoming queries to decide dynamically which queries are worth caching, rather than having to be explicitly instructed by the developer ahead of time to cache certain tables he *guesses* will be worth saving. newlinechar  newlinechar It's the equivalent of complaining that 'the manual memory allocation in Java is terrible'.  Well yeah, it is, but only because the whole *point* of Java is that you shouldn't ever have to worry about that, instead leaving it up to the compiler/interpreter. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously there *are* cases where you want to create temporary tables and the like, but these are very much edge cases that all the optimisation and the entire system was designed to avoid. newlinechar  newlinechar So - without wishing to sound rude - that's two irrelevant personal preferences and one case of You're Doing It Wrong... do you have any other examples of why SQL is actually a *bad* language, rather than merely a verbose one, or one generally designed to avoid ever having to do what you were trying to do with it? ;-)

Priests probably actually aren't paedos. Priests most likely just act out using children as a substitute, rather than actually being attracted to them, similar to how you are not attracted to your hand when you masturbate. They have access to alter boys, thus they use alter boys.

Or you could simply make the assumption that if there is actually a god, he simply isn't as all-knowing as he pretends to be; that would be quite consistent with the bible. For example, Omniscient god says: 'wait, they're going to eat from the tree if I make it? Alright. Better not put that there.' Not-so-omniscient god says: 'Hm, that tree kind of looks nice in the garden. Eve, what do you think? Yummy, eh? Anyways, don't eat from it or I'll have to torture you and your kids for eternity.

So, let me get this straight.  You are attracted to children specifically, but do not act upon it and are morally opposed to acting upon it for fear of hurting the children?  The biggest thing for me is never risking hurting children, they can't really tell if they're ready or not (I know from personal experience) and it's not loving to put a loved one someplace that might hurt them. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, if you are morally opposed to pursuing a relationship with a child and the extent of the 'pornography' you view is stuff that is...'less' exploitative (though the exploitation wouldn't be on you in this case, more on the fashion industry or whatnot) then I guess I see you as a fairly strong person.  It would suck a lot to be in that situation, but it would seem like you're doing the right thing.  Just never risk fucking up a child, I know from experience how much that can ruin a life, it's hard to understand unless you've been through it.

'If you make the statement that 'all child-adult sex is rape' then you must be clear about the definition of child and adult.' newlinechar  newlinechar Really? You can’t define those words yourself? How about this... our laws and the society we live in have decided to define the age of consent as 18. That is good enough of a defiition for me. Now, the guy that started this post says he is attracted to children as young as 2 years old so why not look at that specific example? A 2 year old is a child and an 18 year old is an adult. See, pretty simple.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, we don't know how old chrisissuper is but we do know that he apparently does not find it instantly obvious that a child cannot make an informed decision about sex with an adult. To not instantly recognize that is to not understand children which implies youth or at the very least, a lack of experience with children.  newlinechar  newlinechar I insulted him because he took my words completely out of context and the asked that I defend them.

They are just boring. Apparently not having fun makes you cool? Being aloof and too cool for whatever's happening makes you seem like you totally have better thinks you could be doing, but you deigned to show up here.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Fucking pretentious isn't it?
Of course not. But if you were gay (for example) and you had a problem with it, you could choose not to have sex, and you could work to avoid thinking about it. There will obviously be times when the thought would come unbidden, but it is your choice whether you dwell on it and pursue it, or allow the thought to pass. newlinechar  newlinechar With paedophilia, then surely that would be the only way you could stay sane? Wouldn't you need a coping strategy? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm gonna go out on a limb here and actually profess some measure of sympathy for non-active paedophiles. Kind of. Of all the kinks, twists and fetishes, it is one of the few that is not only arguably unhealthy (could be caused by/symptom of some dysfunction/aberration  of biology or psychology) but also universally regarded as wrong (and, imho, rightfully so) - only other things I can think of that fit in that category would be scat (unhealthy, but I wouldn't say wrong), snuff (should be obvious) and rape / anything non-consensual (wrong, varying degrees of unhealthy). The end result being an uncontrollable urge with no possible happy ending - if you act on it, somebody -will- get hurt. newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds like a great recipe for lifelong torment, to me. newlinechar  newlinechar That said: we're thinking beings, fully aware of others being like ourselves; we're empathic. We know when we're harming someone; we know right from wrong. As soon as you cross the line and hurt someone, my sympathy ends. newlinechar  newlinechar The OP scares and angers me because throughout the thread he's justifying it by saying he 'loves' them, and is trying his damndest to make a case that it doesn't necessarily mean harm. This sounds very much like the precursor to action, rather than the words of someone who is in an effective programme.

I take it you don't really understand what it means to be published in a peer reviewed journal.

How can you possibly compare being gay to being a pedophile? And you say I'm not reading what I'm writing!  newlinechar  newlinechar Homosexuality is nothing at all like pedophilia. One very fundamental difference is that homosexuals are adults who can choose to have relations with each other and it is very much a two way street. A pedophile has a predatory relationship with his 'partner'. The child is in a markedly inferior position while the pedophile is in a completely dominant one.  newlinechar  newlinechar OK I will clarify my blanket statement to Verroq... he is not a bad person because he has these feelings. He's a bad person for not seeing these predatory feelings as wrong and for trying to justify them.

You seem very insightful. May I ask you a question? I have always wondered about this. From the child's point of view, what about the sexual encounter with adults is 'harmful'?

Those are fair arguments - I assumed you were criticising SQL's utility as a query language, but if I understand you correctly you're instead criticising its verbosity and imprecise, inconsistent grammar - correct? newlinechar  newlinechar These are fair enough grounds to criticise a language on, but not the most important aspect, IMO. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd say on the strength of its expressiveness that SQL was 'a perfectly acceptable query language with some flaws in its verbosity and irregular grammar'... whereas from the sound of it you'd say it was 'an awful, verbose, inconsistent language which nevertheless *functionally* was perfectly acceptable' - fair? ;-) newlinechar  newlinechar I think ultimately we were considering it from two different angles. newlinechar  newlinechar The SQL language *as a tool* is - while not unimprovable - still perfectly acceptably useful and expressive. newlinechar  newlinechar The SQL language *as a language* is verbose and inconsistent, at least compared to more modern languages.

Could you give me an example of something that you would consider hard? 'Making the behavior believable' and 'catching all the edge cases' when you have several systems interacting in complex, emergent ways (e.g. look at all the bugs in the article due to imperfect feedback and integration between path finding, path following and behavior modeling) seems to me the textbook definition of a hard engineering problem. Aside from the general problems of the field, the game AI programmer also has to contend with a lot of game design requirements that cannot be condensed down to a handful of easily expressed axioms; most games are messy. All these special cases often contravene the expectations of the more generic AI systems and behaviors, which leads to an explosion in the number of edge cases.

I learned something fascinating about the psychology of paedophilic priests in my abnormal psych course, actually. newlinechar  newlinechar When you are a kid, you are naturally attracted to people of your same age.

Rule Revisions: newlinechar  newlinechar I think that one week is plenty for people to listen to the album and discuss it. We're just going to drop the second thread idea and let people comment on the original thread. newlinechar  newlinechar __________________ newlinechar  newlinechar Discussion: newlinechar  newlinechar He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot - I think this song is a great introduction to the album and the bleak atmosphere is a nice set up for the rest of the album. The piano gives it a nice organic feel and contrasts nicely with the synths. newlinechar  newlinechar Hewlett's Daughter - cute and poppy, this song contrasts nicely with the previous and next songs. newlinechar  newlinechar Jed the Humanoid - I love the lyrics in this song. The concept of depressed robots is weirdly awesome. newlinechar  newlinechar The Crystal Lake - back on the poppy end of the spectrum, I like how the moods song to song vary so much but the album sounds cohesive as a whole. newlinechar  newlinechar Chartsengrafs - Don't like this one all that much, I don't hate it though. newlinechar  newlinechar Underneath the Weeping Willow - Pretty melody, almost sounds like a lullaby. newlinechar  newlinechar Broken Household Appliance National Forest - Doesn't make much sense newlinechar  newlinechar Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground) - one of my favourite songs on the album. I really like how the distorted synth (the high-low-high-low-etc part) kind of resembles a warning siren as if to lament Jed's failing systems. Plus that line that goes 'I try to sing it funny like Beck / But it's bringing me down' is awesome. newlinechar  newlinechar E. Knievel Interlude (The Perils of Keeping It Real) - skip newlinechar  newlinechar Miner at the Dial-A-View - These next two songs are definitely my favourites.

Beautiful melody. The vocals are extremely reminiscent of Thom Yorke's style.

They don't work for us (civilians). My belief is that they work for the system called government.  newlinechar  newlinechar A boss cannot pay an employee more than the boss makes.

*(see response to hidden101 below)* newlinechar  newlinechar I pretty much agree with you on all of your points.  The world would likely be much better off without nationalism or religion, and the two will definitely have to change if the world is to become a more cooperative place.  The only thing I'm trying to dismantle is the idea that religion is *inherently evil*.   newlinechar  newlinechar If I'm reading you correctly, religion is pretty much like a weapon in that it amplifies the evil of bad people, can help good people do bad things, and we'd generally be better off without it.  One could say the same for most weapons, but this doesn't mean there's anything *evil* about them. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Edit: Religion: more weapon than tool, but arguably still useful.  Distribute with care.

How much it costs to employ someone and what return you get on that investment are not the same as 'raw hours worked'. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, many employers allow flexible hours and family benefits because they find it increases retention and employee loyalty - that is a benefit to the employer, one that they value more than 'make 'em work 90 hours a week'. newlinechar  newlinechar You're also assuming that employers look at all employees' contributions equally. This is true in the ideal sense, but sadly, many employers (speaking from experience here) view 'time off for family' far more negatively than 'time off for doing things the employer would do' - even when the former is equal or smaller than the latter.
I think there are many things to take into account here. One facet I would recognize is that housing prices are dropping. In areas like Las Vegas, Phoenix etc. huge drops have been made.

I agree with your sentiment, but atheism isn't necessarily anti-god as it is disbelief in the idea.  newlinechar  newlinechar And everyone is labeled something in one way or another. Look at it this way, there are so many people who belong to a certain faith that it has become necessary to distinguish ourselves from them. Its just the way it is....for now, anyway. You can say, I'm not a christian but they'll ask if you're catholic, or muslim, or buddhist. See, that doesn't work either. So you can either say you aren't religious or don't believe in religion...or say you are atheist. I mean, among circles of people who know what that word really means, its not a bad label to have. It only becomes problematic to fundies who think you are satanic or a moral-less heathen.

Silver is  an old remedy, used before antibiotics.  It works as an antibacterial, though much less well than conventional antibiotics.  If you misuse it or use the wrong kind, it can permanently turn your skin blue like a smurf.  Although I hope that CS is taken more seriously and studied, right now I don't think there's any reason to think it's safer than conventional antibiotics.

Despite the awful things you hear about lobbyists, for the most part we're just forging a link between constituents and policymakers.

I don't understand the emotional introversion sometimes. I have repeatedly dated guys who won't tell me when stuff if bothering them. What gives?
Yeah. They drive me nuts. I once saw a dog attack two dogs and decided to go over and chewed out the owner. Rather than pinning or scolding the dog, she sat down with the dog almost in tears and had a little chat. From the dog's perspective she might as well have been congratulating it. The dog then went on to attack my dog a few minutes later and I grabbed it and pinned it immediately. I told her that if she wasn't the hell out of the park in 30 seconds I was calling the cops.

This is a communist outrage.  People have grown weak in this country and our country is not able to compete anymore on an international level, which is the only important thing.  It's a nanny state of entitlement that has ruined us.  Unions were important to quality of life in this country when jewish people were disenfranchised immigrants, but now that they are established as the governing class, we have to let the black and mexican working class actually work for a living.  Red necks, black people and mexicans are too stupid to understand workers rights anyway.  We need to do away with these absurd child labor laws and put them to work so they lose their sense of entitlement and don't have time to think about making trouble in their youth.  We can't establish a world financial order if we don't have a class of people that are willing to sacrifice their dreams of contentedness to the cause of internationalism.  It was different when workers rights benefited poor jewish people, but those days are long past, and it's time to end this madness.

OK I got it.  I found the answer to the troll problem.  This method should be effective for both old and new visitors. newlinechar  newlinechar We can start a campaign to get the Reddit website programmers to integrate an option for each Reddit user to make any other user's comments disappear from your screen. newlinechar  newlinechar Since you are already familiar with the greasemonkey script method I've laid out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/8gl2t/my_handydandy_guide_to_solving_the_antitruther/c097m4n), the website programmers could integrate something like this into the website itself. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, underneath the comment of all users, each of us have the option to Permalink parent report reply. newlinechar  newlinechar Why not add an 'ignore user' option?  One click, and from then on you will never see any comments or PMs from that user.  In effect, your personal account blocks all communications from the user you choose to 'ignore'. newlinechar  newlinechar I believe that this is the best option, because not only will it not replace the voting system, but each person has the freedom to see or ignore any user's comments and not have to report users to the site moderators. newlinechar  newlinechar This will make the moderators job a lot easier. newlinechar  newlinechar What do you think?  I don't think it will be too difficult to integrate this option into Reddit. newlinechar  newlinechar

This is a subreddit for discussions about Christianity. newlinechar  newlinechar I have received complaints from various Christians who feel there is a disproportionate amount of trolling and other non-productive activities going on. And I have to say even as a less than active and attentive moderator, I had  feelings in a similar fashion, before I started receiving complaints. newlinechar  newlinechar However as we all know from Reddit, one man's troll is another man's guru. newlinechar  newlinechar So rather than just ban a bunch of people based on a small number of reports, I figured what we should do is have an open and honest discussion about what people are feeling and thinking about all this. newlinechar  newlinechar I founded this reddit because I am a Christian, and I don't think Christianity is incompatible with liberal morality, social justice or many other good things. Reddit is very atheist heavy, which can lead to problems for Christians. For example, when I found myself several months ago spending several hours re-batting down the whole buffet of nonsense memes, like Christianity is the equivalent of older minority cult religion X, etc. I felt it was necessary to have a place to discuss actual Christian issues on Reddit. newlinechar  newlinechar However I did not want this reddit to be all milk and honey, simply because the human implementation and practice of Christianity has created a lot of harm, as well as good. So I would rather this space be used for the honest discussion of the real problems, from whatever background anyone had on these issues. newlinechar  newlinechar If you have stumbled across me in other areas of reddit, or read my profile, you probably know my interests are much more political than religious. And I have pretty distinct perspectives in those areas. However I don't think have a perspective denies the ability of hosting and participating in honest and active discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar It's very likely there are other issues within this subreddit community I am not taking into account in this discussion, and I would appreciate it for any and all to bring them forward. But the starting place should definitely be from the reality of the complaints I have received. newlinechar  newlinechar Christianity should be challenged and questioned, however there is a point as mentioned by liquidpele, when this becomes unproductive and is motivated by activities and behaviors other than those inherent in honest discussion. Not always the case, but it definitely happens. And based on the complaints it is certainly perceived to be happening more frequently than it should. newlinechar  newlinechar So the best way to find out what is really going on is to get everyone talking to each other about it Reddit style.

What the hell are you trying to say with this tired, pointless polemic?    I really, really, really want to believe this is meant to be a piece of satire. In case it is not though, you have some reactionary and downright contradictory opinions about workers rights and world affairs. In the same breath you sympathize with the plight of Jews, a historically marginalized and oppressed group, but condemn 'red necks, black people and mexicans' as 'too stupid to understand workers rights anyway'. Never mind the fact that all these groups comprise the class of workers. In your mind, they're undeserving of such basic human rights as people like you--and judging by the dominant audience demographic of Reddit--that means  a white male, age 21-27.         newlinechar      newlinechar      newlinechar As for the issue of child labor, see [the wikipedia entry on the Factory Acts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Acts) for what amounts to a historical indictment of the practice. Child labor was the lifeblood of the capitalist before labor was exported to the third world, but the end result was the same--overwork for little pay.         newlinechar 'We can't establish a world financial order if we don't have a class of people that are willing to sacrifice their dreams of contentedness to the cause of *internationalism*' This doesn't make any sense. Internationalism is the true goal of socialist revolution according to Marx. Workers the world over have more in common on the basis of social class than by arbitrary national divisions. You--for whatever reason you care to not articulate--see internationalism as necessary for the purposes of preserving the hegemony of the existing order that exploits the working class.     newlinechar In short, as a fellow worker, I wish you'd disabuse yourself of such reactionary views.
Feeding is one of the activities dogs use to jockey for pack lead. newlinechar  newlinechar When you feed a dog, you do so on your terms. You are showing dominance, and that you control the food and feeding times. You should only allow dogs to eat for about 5 minutes, and then take the bowls up if they walk away. If you have more than one, you should feed in separate bowls and stick around, not allowing one dog to push the others away from their bowls. newlinechar  newlinechar When you leave food out all the time, the dog gets to feed on his/her own terms independent of you. You are seen more as an equal than pack leader. It also allows the dog to position for pack leader of the food by warning other dogs away. newlinechar  newlinechar It is good that it worked out for you leaving food out, but more frequently depending on dog temperament it wouldn't. You'd either get a fat or temperamental dog. Food aggression should be dealt with swiftly and dominantly.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you get a growl, the dog should get a swat on the rear, grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, take it outside or into another room and close the door until feeding is over or about 5 minutes. The dog should get no more food during that breakfast or dinner. From then on at every feeding you should attempt to take his/her food and if you get a growl do the same thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar At the same time if you have other dogs, you should start feeding the dominant one on the other side of the room from the others and not allow the others to get close during feeding. This will decrease the tension of the aggressive dog.

That's my feeling.  I really hope I never end up on trial, or involved in a lawsuit.  But if it ever happens, I don't want 12 people who are marginally intelligent, or don't have anything better to do during the day!   newlinechar  newlinechar I gripe about serving, and about the pay (I'm sure it was set by law back when $7 a day was not too different from an average salary).  But I always show up, and I don't try to get kicked off.  I am fully aware of jury nullification, but I don't bring it up if they don't ask.  If they do I will remind them of the Zenger case (and probably get rejected.)  I am opposed to drug and other laws which make 'crimes' out of non-criminal activity.   newlinechar  newlinechar I've done one trial so far.  I had a suspicion that the accused was guilty.  But the victim of the assault lied almost continuously.  He was in a go-go bar, claimed that the accused had just called him over for no reason and then beat the crap out of him.  I think it actually had something to do with meth, and monies owed.  Even with that, it would have been easy to convict, but the cops were really sloppy.  They only came up with circumstantial and otherwise useless evidence; and the prosecutor used a lot of innuendo and implication.  If they'd had even one solid piece of evidence I would have voted to convict.  But they did not do their jobs. newlinechar It looked like the other jurors were ready to convict as soon as we got to the jury room, but myself and one other juror did our best to show why the case hadn't really been proven.

Its essentially indentured servitude. Something that I thought was banned a long time ago. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; An indentured servant is a form of debt bondage worker.

So I call myself a vegetarian even though I eat fish and seafood.  While it has something to do with the suffering that most vegetarians site as their reason (and it is a really good one).  I do it personally for the health aspects.  Fish is high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids which decrease your chance of heart disease and several types of cancer.  Red meats are much higher in Omega-6 fatty acids which are responsible for the inflammatory cascade in your body.  This can lead to all sorts of health issues.  Most importantly, since I stopped eating meat, I no longer get that stuffed, gross feeling you get right after eating a burger or a high meat product.

Or in other words, money flows upwards from the poor to the rich, in the natural order of things.

I agree with the mind-reading thing. I think I have an explanation, too. The women I know notice *everything*. Subtle changes in posture, tone of voice, all the little signs (verbal and other wise) that indicate someone's mood/disposition/feelings. newlinechar  newlinechar For example. Kayla and I are in a room, chatting about our day with our laptops on our laps, mindlessly googling/redditing. Eye contact is easily maintained. Heather walks in and sits down and starts to join the conversation. Kayla looks at her computer screen more often, and makes less eye contact .  = Kayla finds Heather to be annoying/intrusive.  Women, am I right? newlinechar  newlinechar The men I know, on the other hand, don't recognize these changes (at least not to the same extent) and are terrible at interpreting them. It's not mind reading, its just (overly) careful observation and (at times ridiculous) amounts of interpretation.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Actually, it only takes 1 click on the Mac.  If you've got a Finder window open (the probability of this is pretty high if you've got a removable volume connected), there's a handy 'eject' icon right next to the name of the volume.  Otherwise, select the volume and hit ⌘-E. newlinechar  newlinechar I understand that, as the article states, this is consistent with the intended use patterns that Microsoft had when Windows 95 came out.  However, I think that today, with the context provided by pretty much *every other system tray icon ever*, they should really revise this.  The user expectation is that right-clicking the icon provides a menu, while double-left-clicking opens a window, and left-clicking does nothing.  Because of this, most Windows users I know *do* in fact take 5 clicks to 'Safely Remove' devices.  Microsoft has been more than happy to change their usability standards in cases like Office 2007, and I don't see why such a simple and obvious fix has escaped them for so long. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, one thing I have never quite understood in Windows (this dates from XP, so I'm not sure if it's been fixed in Vista): You can right-click on a disk in Explorer and select 'Eject disk,' but Windows still doesn't say that it can be safely removed (still unmounts it, though).  Never was able to figure that one out.

It was a while ago, and I have to admit I was a bit nervous as this was my first time arguing with the judge and lawyers in front of a full courtroom.

Of course it's a mutual agreement. They're agreeing to *be married*, not to have a wedding ceremony, get married and then go their separate ways.

I think now you are hitting up against the limitations of graphic design, developer time and 3d engine design. newlinechar  newlinechar Each new player model they add to the game increases the system requirements and the workload to continue developing the game, forever. newlinechar  newlinechar Every armor texture, every weapon texture, every spell, every animation, etc needs to be redeveloped for every general character model.  These take hundreds of work hours per model and increase the system requirements of every single person that plays the game. newlinechar  newlinechar Reasons like this make the idea of developing lots of character models technically and practically unworkable. newlinechar  newlinechar So they have to strike a balance.  There is going to be one basic human male model, one basic human female model, etc with a few changes in hair color or facial features, but that is it. newlinechar  newlinechar But theres dwarves, gnomes, undead, elves, orcs and last I heard some sort of goat race too, all with unique models, textures, body types, lore, etc.  Its a balance based on what can reasonably be accomplished within the lore and the real world development cycle.  Players can pick any they want from those choices, pick their hairstyle and get down to playing.  If the human female isn't to your liking, pick a different one.  Half the fun of a fantasy game is pretending you are someone else. newlinechar  newlinechar So they strike a balance between system requirements, developer time and their market.  Their single biggest market is going to be males 15-40 years old because these are the people who play the most games in general and the ones who played through the whole warcraft series and are high on the lore. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if it was practical from a development perspective, would anyone be happier if there was a slider bar on the character creation screen that let you choose from AA - DD breast size any time a female character was created, or would we just be reading an article that a videogame is somehow ethically wrong because 90% of the players slide that bar to DD every single time?

&gt; I personally see why it is nice to have .net support on Linux as it allows people to migrate from windows easier. newlinechar  newlinechar I can understand this argument or this idea, but I'm really not sure whether it actually works or works out that way - even in the end. newlinechar  newlinechar ..software development never seems to have an end to it.. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe there is a chance people think that they can use .Net on Windows now, anyway, instead of the JVM or Mono, on Windows too, because there is always Mono if they want to switch or deploy to Mac or Linux later. newlinechar  newlinechar But does it really work? Is it very, too, convenient to use .Net specific features? Will it always be like this? Is Mono just a J# or is it .Net which is the real J#? newlinechar  newlinechar ..so many unknowns. Why take the risk at all? ...but I can see a benefit for someone or a group of people with a lot of _already_ invested knowledge etc.

This is exactly the situation we have at work. We use Oracle and I've looked at Postgres which looks great data-wise. But we rely on loads of PL/SQL features that we would have to write ourselves if we switched to Postgres. It's cheaper to stay with Oracle for now. newlinechar  newlinechar They need a solid language that works with native SQL data types and a massive library base to compete properly with Oracle. PL/pgSQL doesn't seem that great from what I've seen. I imagine MySQL is in a similar situation, they have the database part down, it's the tools on top that are lacking.

&gt;The coconut crab, especially if it is not yet fully grown, is also sold as a pet, for example, in Tokyo. The cage must be strong enough that the animal cannot use its powerful claws to escape.

Thomas Hale Streets reports the following trick, used by Micronesians of the Line Islands, to get a coconut crab to loosen its grip: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar *It may be interesting to know that in such a dilemma a gentle titillation of the under soft parts of the body with any light material will cause the crab to loose its hold.* newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Children sometimes play with coconut crabs by placing some wet grass at an angle on a palm tree that contains a coconut crab.

&gt; However as we all know from Reddit, one man's troll is another man's guru. newlinechar  newlinechar The key is *civil discussion*.  Many atheists here simply discuss things on a rational level in a civil way with those with whom they disagree; there's nothing wrong with that. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to find the people who ought to be banned, ask those atheists who constructively contribute to civil discussion which atheists they think are trolling, and hit them with a level 32 banhammer.  I imagine they'd suggest the same people I would: the ones whose posts constantly end up downmodded into oblivion at the bottom of the comment page because they're trying to wake up the 'sheeple' or being insulting without making any serious point.  Plus, you have the added assurance that it's not just ideological bias: the ones you ban are the ones *the leaders of their own community* rejects as trolls. newlinechar  newlinechar So, atheists who post civilly in the Christianity subreddit: who do you find yourself downmodding repeatedly? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; my interests are much more political than religious. newlinechar  newlinechar As an aside, have you ever read [The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-dott-soc_en.html)?  I'm sure it would provide interesting reading for someone who's liberally inclined politically, but conservatively inclined religiously.  In particular, I really enjoy this quotation: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;&gt; The demands of the common good are dependent on the social conditions of each historical period and are strictly connected to respect for and the integral promotion of the person and his fundamental rights. These demands concern above all the commitment to peace, the organization of the State's powers, a sound juridical system, the protection of the environment, and the provision of essential services to all, some of which are at the same time human rights: food, housing, work, education and access to culture, transportation, basic health care, the freedom of communication and expression, and the protection of religious freedom. Nor must one forget the contribution that every nation is required in duty to make towards a true worldwide cooperation for the common good of the whole of humanity and for future generations also.

Well, dirty matt... I'm going to broaden this discussion, beyond the scope of what you intended it to be - because I have some important points to make here about sociology. I see conversants like you as being the problem, not folks who talk like me. And I'll tell you why I think that way. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Do you realize that any group which believed something different than mainstream society does would be considered a threat by you? Why and how? Because they wouldn't adhere to the social mores which you hold dear in precisely the same way you do. Oh well. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lighten up, dirty matt. Cease with your crusades. The internet is the tool that is going to change how we as a society reach our conclusions, and how we study issues. You can't fight it. Everybody has certain convictions which diverge from the mainstream opinion. The internet allows such people to get together anonymously and chat about it. If that makes you scared - I think you are the person with the problem. You need to just chill out. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's not dangerous for people to come together to form a different conclusion about some aspect of life than mainstream society has reached - such as anti-vaxxers and pedophiles on the net (two 'notorious' examples). What's dangerous is for a society to react harshly to such groups. People who threaten them, and deride them are the bane on our society, dear sir. What happens sociologically, when mainstream society refuses to allow this effect? Well, group-think on a national scale. People have to reason conscientiously about things... and they have the right to share their conclusions with others who agree with them. Do you know what happens when people with divergent convictions are treated poorly? Intellectuals who feel the antipathy then will devote their time to supporting putrid social movements like reddit, or the 1950s 'beat generation,' or 'punk rock.' Why? Because when you persecute people for having a different conviction than you do, they will learn that adding rancor to the mix actually will serve them better in promoting their ideology. When the public sees a mess, it is more likely to reassess its own position. This is why the history of the usa is a series of progressive movements which involved lots of rancor and lots of friction between a fringe group and mainstream society.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Think about it. I insist that it's time to stop raising antipathy towards groups which think differently than you. If they're mistaken... tell how you think that they are mistaken. They will suffer the consequences of their error in judgement. But, you won't.

Thank you, especially for the spanish exclamation marks! newlinechar  newlinechar Copy-pasted the significant ones from wikipedia's article on nullification. If you're in California, the 2001 ruling is the strongest point to go with: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) 'In 1670, William Penn was arrested for illegally preaching a Quaker sermon. Despite the fact that the judge demanded a guilty verdict and that preaching the sermon was illegal, the jury in that case acquitted Penn and was subsequently imprisoned, fined, and kept for three days without food or water as a result. Four jurors refused to pay the fine, and one, Edward Bushnell, obtained a writ of habeas corpus. Chief Justice Vaughn, sitting on the highest court in England, discharged the writ, released them, and called the power to punish a jury 'absurd'. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) A 1969 Fourth Circuit decision, U.S. v. Moylan, affirmed the right of jury nullification, but also upheld the power of the court to refuse to permit an instruction to the jury to this effect: newlinechar  newlinechar 'We recognize, as appellants urge, the undisputed power of the jury to acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by the judge, and contrary to the evidence. This is a power that must exist as long as we adhere to the general verdict in criminal cases, for the courts cannot search the minds of the jurors to find the basis upon which they judge. If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused, is unjust, or that exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the power to acquit, and the courts must abide by that decision.' newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar 3) In 1972, in United States v. Dougherty, 473 F.2d 1113, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling that affirmed the de facto power of a jury to nullify the law but upheld the denial of the defense's chance to instruct the jury about the power to nullify. However, in Dougherty the then-chief judge David L. Bazelon authored a dissenting in part opinion, arguing that the jury should be instructed about their power to render the verdict according to their conscience if the law was unjust. He wrote that refusal to allow the jury to be instructed constitutes a 'deliberate lack of candor'.[15] newlinechar  newlinechar 4) In 2001, a California Supreme Court ruling on a case involving statutory rape led to a new jury instruction that requires jurors to inform the judge whenever a fellow panelist appears to be deciding a case based on his or her dislike of a law.[16] However, the ruling could not overturn the practice of jury nullification itself because of double jeopardy: a defendant who has been acquitted of a charge cannot be charged a second time with it, even if the court later learns jury nullification played a role in the verdict'
Nah, it's not a constant thing, but it happens now and again and it's still upsetting for her when she wakes up after these types of dreams, so it has proven helpful to have a basis by which we can discuss them.  Don't tell me that my wife is the only one out there who has dreams that seem very realistic immediately after waking, regardless of how silly the premise may be.   newlinechar  newlinechar I've had dreams where I broke the law, speeding, stealing, etc, and when I wake up it is such a huge relief to realize that it was a dream (and that I'm not going to go to prison) that I can imagine what it must be like for her to process waking up from a very upsetting dream and trying to process the reality of being awake. newlinechar  newlinechar I once dreamed that my wife died.  I don't remember the details but I do remember that when I woke up I was extremely upset and depressed.  It was so realistic that the intense feelings of loss and sorrow that I felt during the dream carried over quite strongly into my waking emotions.  If that's what it's like for her when she wakes up from dreaming about me being an asshole then it's only reasonable to work through those feelings. newlinechar  newlinechar Mark
I think it's quite logical. I'm not saying that vaccines do nothing. They certainly act in the way they are designed to. They effect a reaction in the immune system. What I'm questioning is the general efficacy of that kind of invasive procedure. Does it provide a great deal of benefit? I don't think so. The skin (including the inner 'skin' of the lungs and digestive tract) is the best protection against these viruses and bacteria.
It's not *just* the Iraqis' business, that's my point.  If we've created a shitstorm, we have a moral obligation to ensure the country won't collapse into civil war or severe political unrest as soon as we leave. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Measuring that stability is the hard part. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I do think we're at a point where we don't need to be leading the fight anymore, which is why we've already begun to draw down troops.  We also have an agreement with the Iraqi government that we'll be out in 2011, so the only question left for us is setting the optimal pace of our withdrawal. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And let's be honest, we interfere in a lot of countries.  Or, put another way, we promote our interests using the tools at our disposal (economic, political/diplomatic, and military). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The United States has the power to shape the economic development and political stability of countries all over the world.  Used judiciously, this power has brought a lot of good (think the Marshall Plan, NATO, integration of former Soviet bloc states into the global economy, encouraging economic growth in the [BRIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC), etc.) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If, given our presence in the region, we have a chance to shape the security and economic integration of countries like Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria, it would behoove both us and other industrialized nations to do so.

Some of the comments here and on the NPR page imply they either think a 'green bubble' would be a good thing, or that they think NPR is trying to imply that. Neither is the case. In other words, the article doesn't say we're going to enter a green utopia because of loads of investment, but that there stands to be a bubble of over- and inefficient investment in the green sector. newlinechar  newlinechar What you describe might be the dream of a 'green boom,' but that's not what the people the article cites claim may be coming.

To be fair, we did cover religion in social studies/world history, but only in the broadest possible strokes. newlinechar  newlinechar You could say, 'The pilgrims left for the Americas because they wanted religious freedom.'  But that doesn't *mean* anything, and really conveys very little information (a dubious description of the events aside).  Action without context is not only boring (distills history to the study of dates and names), but disingenuous.
Most beers don't carry the roots or sugars that give root beer it's incredible flavor.  Also, most root beers don't contain alcohol, at least in the US.  I have no idea about other countries.  Mixing them causes them to taste very different from either drink by itself.  If I'm already pretty drunk but I want to keep drinking without getting sick, I'll water my beer down with root beer.  I'm talking about cheap products you can pick up at a local supermarket, and not from a specialty store.  Livin' on a tight budget.  I still want to try the Three Olives' root beer vodka.

&gt;40. At least 7 of the alleged 'hijackers' were reported to be still alive. Neither the FBI nor the 9/11 Commission corrected the identities, and the government has treated the issue of who exactly attacked America on September 11th as relatively unimportant.

&gt; Regardless of whether religious people like to express something in a certain way or not doesn't change the fact that it's wrong newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry, but I think that wrongness is subjective.

There's nothing wrong with that.

I absolutely love the music on this album. I'd only heard of Grandaddy recently when one of their songs showed up in a car commercial (actually, that seems to be how I find a lot of music, ever since Nick Drake's Pink Moon showed up in a VW commercial 10 or so years ago).  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to talk about the lyrics in this post, because I was absolutely blown away by them, not only as individual songs, but also how well the songs seem to fit together into a coherent whole. newlinechar  newlinechar He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot - This one's fairly ambiguous, I'm not sure who '2000 man' is, perhaps just the singer himself. This song seems to be, on the most basic level, about someone who's reaching for something amazing but who is being pulled down by outside pressure from people without the vision he has. The reason I think it might be about the singer is because, from what I can tell, Grandaddy was very much about trying to not get caught up in the corporate music game and focusing instead on writing quality music. newlinechar  newlinechar Hewlett's Daughter - I'm not sure about this one either, I'm not sure who Hewlett is supposed to be, unless it's a reference to one of the founders of Hewlett-Packard. Since this one's pretty packed with apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic imagery, perhaps it's about the destruction of humanity brought about by technology. Awfully poppy and catchy for such a heavy subject, though. newlinechar  newlinechar Jed the Humanoid - I also love this song. On a literal level, the song is about creating a robot and then growing bored with him and forgetting about him, until he eventually becomes lonely and ends his life. On a more metaphorical level, it seems to be about the tendency of society to quickly adopt newer technologies and abandoned older ones, which definitely has ethical implications if we ever do create a true artificial intelligence. newlinechar  newlinechar The Crystal Lake - About being stuck somewhere (a place, or perhaps even a time, or period of time) and wanting to return to a beautiful place where you once were. Given the context of the album, it might be about losing one's self in technology and wanting to return to a time when things seemed simpler and clearer and more beautiful. newlinechar  newlinechar Chartsengrafs - Not much to say about this one, except that it sounds a bit like a Built to Spill song, which I enjoy. newlinechar  newlinechar Underneath the Weeping Willow - Very pretty song, similar lyrical concepts to 'The Crystal Lake.' newlinechar  newlinechar Broken Household Appliance National Forest - This one actually makes a whole lot of sense to me. About a place where the old unwanted household appliance wind up. Perhaps a dump or junkyard, but not necessarily. I see two possible interpretations for this song. The first, that one day humanity will disappear (perhaps destroyed in the events mentioned in 'Hewlett's Daughter?) and our sole legacy will be forests of broken appliances; the second relating back to themes from 'Jed the Humanoid,' about humanity's tendancy to quickly discard the old in favor of the new, and wasteful tendencies in general. newlinechar  newlinechar Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground) - A companion piece with 'Jed the Humanoid,' this one just drives home for me how human Jed really was, and how much more tragic it makes his end. newlinechar  newlinechar E. Knievel Interlude (The Perils of Keeping It Real) - obviously, nothing going on lyrically here, but I dunno how I feel about saying 'skip it.' I'm just not sure what it's trying to say, I get a sense of winding down in this song. Perhaps Jed winding down, since it comes right after a song about him. newlinechar  newlinechar Miner at the Dial-A-View - Great song. This one seems to be about living your life through a virtual world. Sitting at a computer and observing life taking place, instead of going out and actually living a real life and experiencing it for yourself. This song might also be speaking to the addictiveness of technology. newlinechar  newlinechar So You'll Aim Toward the Sky - A simple song, I like how it ties the whole album together, with what seems to be a reference to the first track, 'He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot.' The person is rising above everything, reaching for the sky. Also perhaps escaping from technology, in search of the crystal lake? I'm not sure, but I do like how a song with so few words can so effectively bring together a lot of the themes in this album. newlinechar  newlinechar Overall, I get the sense that this album is about humanity's obsession with technology at the cost of the simple beauty of nature, and the tendency to become to lose sight of our humanity in the face of technological advancement. newlinechar  newlinechar So, wow, long post. These are just my thoughts off the top of my head listening through the album again. I'd love to hear anyone else's thoughts on it. newlinechar

The thing is, (and I am not picking on you, you just made a statement I would like to make a point on) is that dogs don't get *angry* like humans do. They don't bite to get revenge or to take out their stress.  newlinechar  newlinechar They bite for a number of other less emotional reasons. Out of fear, or to show dominance. Out of pain. Teaching a dog that it either will never win dominance or that there are other options when scared or in pain that are more effective than biting is the best way to assure a non-aggressive dog. It's really not that hard either, it's just something I wish was taken into consideration by more people when choosing a pet dog, whether they are pit bulls or teacup chihuahuas.

They develop new character models periodically anyway-- I think there have been at least three scantily clad, large-breasted races added since the last time I actually played Warcraft. I really don't think it's an unreasonable thought that it might be a smart business choice to provide a character model with which young women can identify, someone they want to be because she's strong and beautiful, but not someone whose other traits take a back seat to her breasts and skimpy clothes. newlinechar  newlinechar More and more girls and women are playing video games, and it's only a matter of time until a company comes out with an MMO just as addictive and fun as WoW but with more appeal to women. Blizzard has the advantage of an existing subscriber base, and they're in perfect position to grab that emerging market before someone else does-- but if it's business as usual with them, design for the 15-40 year old male, they're essentially making a gift of that market to the first new MMO that addresses its needs.

If she persists, I go home. newlinechar  newlinechar We've been together for a year and a half so far.  It's been a good relationship.  My first relationship.  I know from what I've said so far you wouldn't know it, but that's because we're talking about the stuff that confounds us.  There's a lot of great things about her too. She's a voluntary teacher in an Adult literacy program, at 24 she has two College degrees, she's a redhead with a great rack, she's adventurous, and she bakes me cookies and muffins on a regular basis.  Also, she has the same pitch black sense of humor as I do.  We saw Crank 2 just recently and she loved it almost as much as I did.  It's hard to ask for more than that.
Dead fucking serious.  The plants give off some sort of gas that makes you kill yourself, but only when there's people in large groups.  Then they start giving it off when there's only like 2 people.  Then for some fucking reason they stop giving it off.  They do it in France, and the movie ends.  Worst 90 minutes of my life.  My friend actually liked it.  A lot.
I don't really do much of anything.  I'm a bit superstitious, so when something happens that makes me (say) cross the street away from the crosswalk, or be walking somewhere via a different route because of some abnormal circumstance, if I pass a store that sells lotto tickets, I'll buy one.  Little, stupid things like that. newlinechar  newlinechar So today, someone called and started talking about the conference call.  I'm like, WTF, do I sound that much like the person she's trying to call, or is she just rushed or something.  After I hung up, I played out a little fantasy where I dial in to the conference call, save the world from swine flu, and then become a world-renown hero.  All because she was off by one number.  So I got to thinking, if I believe that everything happens for a reason, should I be, like, pitching my business' services to people when they misdial me?  Should I ask them a few questions and see if we are long-lost relatives?  What if every time someone called me by mistake, something was supposed to happen? newlinechar  newlinechar Clearly, I'm just a bit crazy.  But it certainly makes *everything* at least a little bit interesting.

It's still going to take an hour of your time to find the repairmen to use, phone him, schedule the appointment, wait for him to arrive, small talk, writing the cheque to him. newlinechar  newlinechar So your $100 for an hour is gone, that's assuming you work every single hour that you're not sleeping. newlinechar  newlinechar And the next time it leaks you are out the same amount, rather then the 1/2 hour is would take you to fix it since you've done it once before. newlinechar  newlinechar

The general pattern you'll see is this: Some pairs of colors will be indistinguishable or nearly so; some single hues (not necessarily the same ones) will suffer from reduced contrast. newlinechar  newlinechar My particular case is this: Red is dim for me.  Even the brightest red is dark compared with green or blue.  So I will have reduced contrast in a gradient of reds.  Because of that, the colors around yellow and the colors around purple, which are distinguished solely by our perception of red, are indistinguishable -- the red is washed out by the (much brighter) blue and green components.  Greens and oranges often look alike to me. newlinechar  newlinechar You see it often quoted that 8% of men are red-green colorblind.  They will roughly match my description.  Blue-green is less common.  There are also people with complete blindness to certain regions of the spectrum and people who can distinguish no color at all.  They are very rare; you should worry about blindness first. newlinechar  newlinechar If that 8% group concerns you, you'll be safe with a gradient in any single color.  I personally find myself at less of a disadvantage -- perhaps with an advantage, even -- with less saturated colors.

The other problem with dalmatians is that 1/4 are completely deaf and 1/4 are deaf in one ear. This is due to the same genes that give them their spots so it cannot be mitigated.

I can't say I've ever really had a personal experience with God, i've been baptized, and I suppose that could be called some type of religious euphoria, but I think it was just being the center of attention in front of a lot of people. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I just don't feel like God has had any direct affect on my life. When I pray I feel like I may as well be talking to a rock, I never see any answer, or even as much as a feeling of reassurance most of the time. newlinechar  newlinechar That is why God doesn't sit well with me, because there has been no tangible reason for me to believe in his existence.  newlinechar  newlinechar As far as advice, I want to know if any of you who have gone through the same experience had some defining moment that changed your viewpoint, or if you realized something you were previously unaware of.

Dragonlance had a variation of Tiamat, an 'other dimension' version called Takhesis, just like they had a version of Bahamut called Paladine.

There's definitely a component of traditional brainwashing. I got up and 'bore my testimony,' for the first time, at age two: no joke.  The temple experience is also classic brainwashing, for adults. newlinechar  newlinechar *But* I think most people, from the outside, fail to see the intricate, and almost entirely internally-consistent, intellectual net.  [I'm going for a really brief explanation, but it's already demanding paragraphs]. newlinechar  newlinechar There's the standard myth to explain the unknown (largely summarized in the ['book of abraham'](http://scriptures.lds.org/en/abr/contents)), which really just adds a layer between the real questions and experienced reality, like all creation myths, but it has a lot more explanatory power than genesis.   newlinechar  newlinechar Then, more importantly, the restoration myth (Joseph Smith story), which brings the modern church into the realm of the magical, invites you to think of yourself as part of a persecuted culture.  If you fully believe that, you can discount any external attack on your silly beliefs, and in fact mormons believe that they'll be rewarded for being persecuted 'for Christ.'  After 10 years I've finally forgotten the scripture, or I'd add a link. newlinechar  newlinechar The really important bit, the glue that makes this stuff stick, is what I think of as misguided-meditation.  You're told that you shouldn't take their word for what they say; you should ask God.  You're taught to do this in a very particular way: read, pray, listen.  The listening is, essentially, meditation.  You're told that you'll feel 'a burning in your bosom,' if you listen properly (quiet your mind), and that this is the 'holy ghost' indicating 'yes it's true.'  As any practitioner of meditation will tell you, this is a result of quieting your mind, not the reading and praying that came before. newlinechar  newlinechar The realization of the meditation thing was the confirmation I needed to move on with my life, but it wasn't what actually prompted me to leave.  If anyone is interested in that, I'll explain, hopefully briefly. ;)

Because being fat is a result of inactivity and choice of diet. A very small proportion of obese people are that way as a result of some glandular problem, and are obese because they simply don't exercise and eat poorly. It is a disease that it self-chosen.

The fat-people dislike is similar to the Hummer hate on reddit. It's shitting on the well-being of yourself, society, and the starving people all over the world. Triple douche-status.

&gt;rape culture newlinechar  newlinechar Is hatespeech. It classifies one group as bad and the other as a victim and it has no basis in fact.

Saying 'Rape Culture' is the exact same thing and just reinforcing a negative and false stereotype.

I hate to admit it, but it does sound a lot like the fights I used to get in. I can't believe I'm going to write this on the internet, but eh I'm not embarrassed even if people think I'm a crazy ;) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It would usually start out with something stupid and trivial ('I don't think you find me attractive! arghhh!'), and then it would escalate into a disagreement/argument. At this point, I would often realize that I was totally overreacting, but I'm stubborn and don't really want to admit that my argument is totally baseless. So then it escalates into a Big Fight, and now I really really can't admit that this whole screaming debacle was all because I was too embarrassed to admit that I was wrong. So then he might say 'wtf are you doing this just to make me angry?' and its easy to give a passive aggressive response - it somehow validates your argument if it looks like you did it on purpose, and in the heat of an argument, looking like you're a bitch in control is preferable to admitting your vulnerabilities and embarassment. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As I said before though, we really never get in those kinds of fights anymore. We still get in disagreements about little things, but they are resolved quickly since we've learned to meet in the middle. I'm no longer embarrassed to just admit when I'm overreacting, and he knows that when I get upset about something stupid its usually because I am feeling vulnerable or am stressed about something else. Now our fights usually end in him yelling 'god damnit come here and give me a hug!' I refuse, then he tackles me and tries to fart on my head, and all is well. newlinechar  newlinechar Wow I sound totally batshit. Oh well, I hope it gives you some insight! newlinechar  newlinechar

It helps to have taken higher-level biology and/or anatomy.

These chemicals tell your metabolism that in order to acquire energy, it should look to fat stores instead of food ingested.  The only problem is, it's not a targeted system.  Any fat is fair game, including the protective cushioning layer in your brain and all your body's joints.

For some reason, I cannot reply directly to your post anymore.... ? newlinechar  newlinechar Prayer: you are right. God gets all the credit when things go right, and non of the blame. I had some lengthy discussions with my professors about this, and they realize this. One thing they affirm: God does move through prayer, but in unexpected and unknown ways. Further, the interplay between God's sovereign action and our free-will is always a hot debate. But some of the people I respect, have a slightly different idea: Prayer might not do much. God might not rend the heavens and act on our behalf. But its function and purpose might have more to do with our mindset. Before prayer, we might be fretting about certain things, or worrying. But the act of prayer seems re-align our mindset to a comforting notion that God is in control, whether or not he does our bidding. And it also serves to help us be thankful for what we have, and what he has blessed us with.  newlinechar  newlinechar My own view: well, I don't know. Its pretty clear that God does not answer my specific prayers. But I can see the function of prayer to be more of a mindset altering idea. It helps me be thankful, and helps me process my thoughts. But I certainly don't see any specific interaction between me and God!  newlinechar  newlinechar

My 30 second pitch: newlinechar  newlinechar CS is still a very new field - one doesn't need a PhD in order to make important advances.  However, many interesting problems are known only to specialists in the field, and often the models, simulations, and data sets required to test new ideas are not easy to obtain. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, it is often not clear to a non-expert what problems are considered important and unsolved in a subdomain of CS. newlinechar  newlinechar My proposed solution is simple: apply the 'bazaar' model to algorithmic development and experimentation in a manner similar to software development.  Interact.  Theorize.  Test.  Publish.  Iterate. newlinechar  newlinechar *Anyone here interested in this?* newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  My proposal is centered around experimental/applied CS problems rather than theoretical CS problems, I should have made the distinction earlier.  Nothing against theoretical CS, it's just a little less 'hacker friendly'.

&gt; Anyway, you keep moving your goalposts.  newlinechar  newlinechar Not at all. I'm addressing your independent assertions with separate counterexamples. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;First alimony is wrong because it's paying after the marriage is over newlinechar  newlinechar Spousal support predicated on paying *certain amounts* is wrong. It forces the payer to maintain employment *that they had no obligation to maintain during the marriage*. Why should the *end* of marriage, **raise** the level of obligation from one to the other? newlinechar  newlinechar Again, as I've pointed out several times: while married, either spouse can decide they're sick of their career and become an artist. *It's now up  to the couple to adjust to this new level of income.* The other spouse isn't *entitled* to a certain lifestyle, if their partner doesn't share their material tastes. Yet, if they decide to divorce, because the one thought they were marrying a high-income earner, and doesn't want to be tied down to an aspiring artist, *the budding artist is now obligated to support the other, at the income level they earned before they wanted to become an artist*. newlinechar  newlinechar So the person is again, **forced**, by law, to give up their artistic career and return to a soul-deadening job, or face prison for not paying.  newlinechar  newlinechar And can bankruptcy even clear someone's spousal support obligations? Apparently not in most cases. So even if the person is rendered impoverished, they are being required to work against their will, to support someone else who is perfectly capable of providing for themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar We're not talking about child support here. We're addressing two modern adults who presumably met when both were living independently. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; then it's wrong because you don't get a tangible thing back for it newlinechar  newlinechar You compare spousal support to a student loan. A person takes a loan to obtain a particular benefit: a house, car, or education. They agree to pay back the value of the loan over a certain time. newlinechar  newlinechar It is in no way analogous to a decision by two people to live together and share their resources for the duration of that relationship. That decision certainly doesn't imply an obligation to maintain the other person's standard of living to a certain level following the dissolution of the relationship. newlinechar  newlinechar The legal regime suggesting it does is a relatively recent social development, and one that *in application* clearly benefits women far more than men. It supports the view of women as 'helpless children' who cannot fend for themselves in the big, bad world, so they require men, either fathers, husbands, or ex-husbands, to coddle them and pay their way through life. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;now it's wrong because it's not fault-based. newlinechar  newlinechar This is an entirely separate issue. If the househusband screws the cute gardener and the income-earning wife discovers him, why should she have to support him at all? He violated the agreement between them; surely that should negate it entirely and put them both to where they were before the marriage. If he didn't have her providing for his needs beforehand, why should he be entitled to it after, *when it was his actions that caused the divorce?* newlinechar  newlinechar That he was dependent on her during the marriage is absolutely irrelevant. He chose to do that rather than being employed, and any able-bodied person is capable of finding work that pays enough to get by. newlinechar  newlinechar If they're genuinely facing privation, that should be a matter for social service agencies, not the spouse they wronged. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'That's unfair!!!!' is not a real argument. newlinechar  newlinechar Dishonestly describing other people's arguments is a straw-man fallacy, as well as being uncivil. newlinechar  newlinechar I am arguing against anyone being compelled to work against their will to provide for someone else.  newlinechar  newlinechar You're saying that marriage includes an implicit agreement to pay spousal support, and that because it includes this, arguing against it is 'whining' (or that's the implication of attempting to trivialize and marginalize opposition by reducing it to 'that's unfair!!!'.) newlinechar  newlinechar Blacks can't vote? 'That's unfair!!' newlinechar  newlinechar Women are forced into back-alleys to get abortions? 'That's unfair!!' newlinechar  newlinechar People are forced to work against their will to support someone else *after* their relationship and agreement to mutual support has ended? 'That's unfair!!' newlinechar  newlinechar But the black people who chose to live in America after the civil war, instead of leaving, AGREED, by living in the country, to the unfair racist laws that were in place! They were just whining it was 'unfair!!!' when they AGREED to it! newlinechar  newlinechar See how dismissive and offensive your argument is? newlinechar  newlinechar The very idea that marriage should be a complex legal affair, off which lawyers and courts can make a bundle before and after, is itself wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar If marriage is not working for people, is causing violations of people's rights to bodily self-determination and their right not to be subjected to indentured servitude/slavery, then the laws surrounding marriage must be fixed. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Because there's no easy answer. newlinechar  newlinechar You're being evasive. newlinechar  newlinechar Should spousal support be based on someone's real income, or on what they could hypothetically make, regardless of what they actually want to do? newlinechar  newlinechar Say a woman enters a marriage, and doesn't work for the duration of it. But she had attended university, and has a standing offer at a $100,000 a year job. Yet following the marriage she still doesn't take the job, because she doesn't find working appealing. newlinechar  newlinechar Does the husband making $50,000 still have to support her, or should she be  paying him because she has this hypothetical higher income available? newlinechar  newlinechar

Actually, that's not the right answer. The way Moose uses 'trait' is pretty specific to Moose, and in fact in Moose-speak, a trait and a role are basically the same thing (except traits can be referred to via a short alias name (if that name has been registered)). newlinechar  newlinechar In comp-sci speak, traits usually refers to 'the' traits paper (http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Scha03aTraits.pdf). newlinechar  newlinechar This paper was a major influence on Moose's roles (and also, Perl 6 roles, IIRC).
When/if you have kids, make sure you raise them to have this attitude. Most of what you're seeing is the result of how women are socialized in our culture.
That would potentially be the case.  All I'm saying about the domestic contract part is that you don't enter into other kinds of legal relationships and then plead ignorance after the fact and expect it to be an excuse so why is it ok in family law? newlinechar  newlinechar Spousal support is a controversial concept and it's not always applied perfectly - the legal system is a whole is inherently imperfect but I haven't really heard any better alternatives. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't like seeing absurd results but I also don't like seeing destitute families either.
I'd much rather see a transparent bikini. 
I concur
My perspective is that when you enter into a marriage, you agree that the assets are becoming pooled.  From that point forward, you amass family property.  You make decisions as a family - i.e. one person stays home, one person works, etc. etc.  In the event that a family, on the basis that they are to stay together for ever, makes the decision that one spouse not work for whatever reason, and the marriage dissolves, the non-working spouse is at a significant disadvantage as a result of a family decision. newlinechar  newlinechar In order for the non-working spouse to be put in a position to be self-supporting, they usually need support for a period of time for that to happen.   newlinechar  newlinechar The longer the non-working spouse didn't work, the longer the period of support.  You don't see support orders for a mum that takes a year of mat leave.  You see support orders when a mum and dad have decided that mum will stay home for 20 and look after the kids. newlinechar  newlinechar She has been out of the workforce for 20 years and has no skills.  To expect her to be employable at anywhere near the lifestyle that she enjoyed during the marriage is short-sighted.  As such, she is compensated, via support, for the decision to be out of the work force.  The support is supposed to be just that: support so that she will become self-sufficient. newlinechar  newlinechar It's the same thing if she's actually a he.   newlinechar  newlinechar Think about it from the prospective of the mum who didn't work for 20 years to stay home to raise kids.  When she separates, she has no skills, still has children to support (who are likely in uni at this time) and half of the marital assets (or whatever the arrangement is).  Assets are not income and likely, it will take her a few years to be a in a position to support herself.   newlinechar  newlinechar She likely won't be getting child support because the kids are away at school yet she will have the burden of contributing to her expenses. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you see how that could be really unfair? newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps if you think about it through the socialist paradigm that processes are set up in society to provide a leg up so that one can be self-sufficient.  While I'm sure there are a lot of MRAs and others here who do not believe in socialism, it probably comes as no surprise that I do.  In a lot of ways, the family law system is simply legislating private socialism within the realm of marriage to equalize the parties.  I think it's patently unfair for a woman to make the choice to stay home and raise her kids for 20 years and then be punished financially for that quite extreme sacrifice. newlinechar  newlinechar There are a lot of good policy reasons for this as well.

Because we like to solve problems. If you make it clear, that your problem is you needing to vent, then that's exactly what we do. Otherwise, we start to try to think of ways to solve the perceived problem (your problem with Sherry in this case). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Then again, you could just be venting, in which case I'm the unfortunate victim of my own explanation.
Even so, lets say hypothetically your parents were as influential as your religious book. Your parents can tell you to hurt or kill, but you can watch others/talk to others and gain your own opinion. All it takes is a smidge of intelligence to take what you want from religion and ignore the rest. It is *mostly* peoples' inability to come to their own decisions that leads them to take action against others in the name of their religion, not the religion itself.
i think it's something like 'mirovoi mir' (мировой мир), 'mirovoi' being an adjective formed from 'mir.'  then again that might mean 'peaceful world' or 'peaceful peace' or 'worldly peace' or something.  i'm still learning.   newlinechar  newlinechar in english we do these things like 'world peace' or 'cookie jar' in which the first word acts as a sort of adjective even though it's not, so i'm a little cloudy on how to translate that stuff. 
in the event that you support her for an extended period of time only and you have lived with her long enough to be considered cl or have a child and are in a relationship of some permanence (only if you are in Ontario - it is province to province)  but this is getting awfully close to personal legal advice which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable.  This is not legal advice, just legal information, k? newlinechar  newlinechar You should really see a lawyer if you want to know exactly what would apply to your situation.

I just explained that in my last response to you.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think the system is inherently fair although these are things I do consider unfair like the inherent gender bias re: women caregivers and while I'll get slammed for this, you can blame the patriarchal societal system for that.  I.e. both men and women have traditionally contributed to the idea that women are nurturers and men are providers.  The basic premise is flawed.  That is something that at least MRAs and feminists do agree with.  If the premise is flawed and we both agree to that, how do we fix it? newlinechar  newlinechar By eliminated patriarchy.  The problem with that is that it's a slow process.  The patriarchal system can be blamed for many of the causes and complaints of the MRA movement as well, if not all of them. newlinechar  newlinechar Societal change is slow - look at feminism over the last 50 years.  Lots of gains have been made.  We still have far to go. newlinechar  newlinechar Ok guys, it's friday night and I want to go out for some beers.  Enough feminism and law talk for now.

O(n^3) is worst case. Earley parsers only take O(n^3) on really fucked up grammars. The thing to avoid when writing an Earley parser is staying too close to the text book presentation and using a 2-D array. That forces O(n^2) space consumption. If you use a sparse representation for the columns, your Earley parser will do many grammars in O(n) space and time.

Good god, the misinformation is astonishing.  The AKM is by *no* means a pistol.  Far from it.  Also, the AKM is an improved version of the AK-47. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the caliber does not determine whether or not a weapon is a machine gun.  For instance, the FN Minini is an LMG (**L**ight **M**achine **G**un), yet it's chambered in 5.56x45mm.   newlinechar  newlinechar You're thinking of the difference in terminology between an 'assault rifle' and a 'battle rifle'.

&gt;And this is where Rand went very, very wrong. She couldn't get that people are both, and that warped all her thinking. newlinechar  newlinechar Rand never denied that people can be altruist.  Really, I mean have you actually read anything she wrote? newlinechar  newlinechar In my view, people cannot be both.  We are always and forever self-serving.  Helping an old lady cross the street, giving money to charity, etc, all these things are done by a person in order to feel good about it.  That is selfishness. newlinechar  newlinechar All human action can be categorized as ends sought and means utilized.  No matter what humans do, we do things because there is a purpose to it.  Money, feeling good, better health, happiness, etc.   newlinechar  newlinechar Every uncoerced action we take is to put ourselves into a better state than would exist if we did not act at all.  This is an irrefutable axiom.  Since the act is based on putting ourselves into a better state than before, all action is therefore self-interested action. newlinechar  newlinechar Rand did not go wrong in this respect.  She went wrong in calling seemingly altruistic action as inherently evil if put above the individual's own interests.  But that is impossible.  All action is to better the individual in some way.  Even if it is to gain some smidgen of content feelings or happiness.  It is impossible to go against what is hard wired into our DNA.  Our genes are self-serving.  They want nothing but survival and replication. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Whether what Merck did was illegal or not was not the point. newlinechar  newlinechar The point of what?   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It was unethical, a concept that I would expect a Randian to disagree with, because your concept of ethics is different than mine. newlinechar  newlinechar Unethical how?  We could argue whether it is unethical sure, but what about those who expect Merck to provide medical knowledge to the public at no cost?  Aren't they acting unethical? newlinechar

According to that thread, he's working on (or maybe already released) a version that prompts before installing the whitelist and makes it possible to permanently remove the whitelist (the inability to delete it was a bug, he claims). newlinechar  newlinechar I don't run NoScript and certainly have no desire to install it now, but as long as the dialog doesn't misrepresent its purpose I think this is an acceptable resolution.  Something like, 'NoScript is funded by advertisement revenue, and running AdBlock Plus with the EasyList filter makes it impossible to view ads on noscript.net.  In order to support the project, would you like to install a whitelist for NoScript's advertising partners?' with an off-by-default checkbox below it. newlinechar  newlinechar Showing ads on the changelog page is pretty cheesy, but at least it's better than silently tampering with other extensions.

*If you cannot choose not to work, to decide to live as a monk, or a beachcomber or drifter, you are not free.* newlinechar  newlinechar So, again, we're back to student loans being slavery. Because if I owe Sallie Mae $100,000, I sure as hell can't choose not to work, to live as a monk or a beachcomber or drifter. The fact that I may or may not have gotten something from that loan is irrelevant to your argument: I am a slave because I am not free to choose my livelihood. newlinechar  newlinechar If what you're saying is that it's some kind of conditional slavery, that it's wrong to have to take a job because the debtor is an ex-spouse rather than a bank, we really are at an impasse. newlinechar  newlinechar BTW, if you're a family law attorney I'm sure you'll correct me on this, but determining underemployment is not 'are you ABLE to earn more?' The courts, as I understand it, do not simply look at what you might be able to earn, but at your past employment history and current economic circumstances. newlinechar  newlinechar Now aside from the issue of spousal support - and clearly we're going to have to agree to disagree, because however wrong it is or in what circumstances it might be awarded, it is not 'slavery' - are you really saying that, taking that element out of the bundle, it is *wrong* and *slavery* that married people get rights and responsibilities?

I totally agree with you. I had the same problem with my boyfriend, mismatched sex drive. It drove me nuts, because when I didn't feel like it and he did (which was all the time) he would get depressed when I said no and feel rejected and think that I wasnt attracted to him anymore. And that would piss me off to no end, and I began to really resent him for it and was probably a big reason that I ended up breaking up with him. newlinechar  newlinechar If your wife is on the pill, it can DRASTICALLY reduce your sex drive. Trust me, it happened to me and it was miserable. Tell her to get a non-hormonal IUD instead.  newlinechar  newlinechar Don't cheat on your wife. It will just make you feel guilty and hurt her. You need to try to talk about this whole issue with her, instead of listening to all of us strangers here on reddit.

I'm looking for a nerdy girl. And not 'sorta' nerdy, but truly, hardcore nerdtastic**. I'm looking for the sort of girl who wants to have sex while listening to the orchestral version of 1000 Words... or Techno Syndrome (Mortal Kombat) if you're THAT sort of girl. Do you want to spend post-coital bliss debating the virtues of 4e D&amp;D vs 3e? Are you familiar with the Force, the Schwartz, AND the Nail Side of the Thumb? Are you fluent in Javascript as well as Klingon? (Ok, I'm fluent in neither, but you get the idea!) newlinechar  newlinechar About me: newlinechar -This troper is a white male, mid 30's (although my Wii Fit age is 27, booyah!), bald, 5'8', and ripped at 200 pounds. Unfortunately, I'm 260, so you've got to poke around quite a bit to feel those abs. (It's my dense Asgardian flesh, I swear!) However, I must say that for a bald, short, fat guy, I look AWESOME. I'm kind of like a better looking, buffer, much poorer version of Jerry Holkins of Penny Arcade fame. newlinechar -I'm in an open marriage. (Yes, I am married. Evidently, some have missed this!) If we do hook up, my wife will know about it (and she'll be glad to have the place to herself!), so if either my marriage or her knowing about you bothers you, you'll have to look elsewhere. All five of you that are reading this. newlinechar -I'm looking for either an awesome afternoon or (preferably) a friends with benefits situation. Mainly, I'm looking for someone I can have stress-free, carefree nerdgasms with and not feel self-conscious about being an incredible geek. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's some things I'm looking for specifically: newlinechar -You must have a vagina. I'm posting this in m4w, but I just want there to be no misunderstandings! newlinechar -Age... eh, let's say 18 to 40. I'm realistic enough to know that no 18 year olds are actually going to respond, but I'm ever hopeful! And I'm guessing that if you're wanting to respond to this ad, you're probably not old enough to be my mother... (she's 70, by the way. If you're 70, that's too old. Sorry.) newlinechar -You must be able to host. I'm not going behind my wife's back or anything, but being allowed to play and playing in her bed while she's trying to watch TV in the other room are two different things... newlinechar -I don't have a car, so unless you're either willing to pick me up or can dispatch War Rocket Ajax to bring back my body, you need to be within walking distance of a bus stop. Also, for the love of Christ, if you CAN'T come pick me up, please live in or near Seattle. I've met women on here before, but for the most part, they're down in Tacoma and Olympia... I take the bus, people! There's GOT to be nerds here up north! (But if you DO drive, and you live in Centralia or wherever, hey come on up! I promise to put out! ;-) newlinechar -I'd prefer it if you were a non-smoker, but it's not a deal breaker. 420 is ok, although I've gotten nothing but seared lungs out of trying the stuff. Anything stronger than Plutonian Nyborg is right out, however. newlinechar -Looks... it's tough to say. I'm not going to say that attraction isn't important, but I have varied and strange tastes, so it's impossible to predict if I'm going to find you attractive or not. Case by case basis, I guess. Height, couldn't care less. Weight... I'm a bit of a chubby chaser, but skinny or fat doesn't matter too much to me. I'm open to all races, with preference being given to Twileks. newlinechar -The kinkier and more carefree you are, the better. I'm willing to try almost anything (although 'Two Nerds, One Cup' is NOT going to happen). Wanna play Bulma and have me play Vegita (or Trunks, if you're REALLY kinky)? Sure! Do you want to pretend to be Princess Leia, captured by the Imperial Navy and 'interrogated'? Why not? (Although I'll probably be vaguely insulted if you want me to be Jabba the Hutt.) Or maybe you just want to fuck and then watch some Dragon Half. Awesome! The point is, I want this to be stress-free, fun, and SHAMELESS. newlinechar -You must respond with a pic to get a response back. I'm not an evil pic collector (muahahaa!)... I just want to make sure I'm not talking to my sister, co-worker, or some other person I know. newlinechar  newlinechar So, there you go. Will I get any responses, who's to say? But what the hell. You only live once! And possibly, some lovely, shy nerdess out there will respond and we can reach.... NERDVANA. newlinechar  newlinechar **If you're NOT a nerd, but think I'm funny and/or interesting (hey, it could happen!) and want to respond anyways, feel free! I'm easy like Sunday morning. newlinechar

If what you say is true - and I agree with it to some extent - then all the Republicans have to do is adhere to fiscal conservatism to regain much of their power.  When the economy is in as much trouble as it is certain social issues will quickly take a back seat. newlinechar  newlinechar But the lack of fiscal responsibility is exactly why republicans are *currently* in trouble.  Their spending over the last 8 years was egregious as well.  But the Obama administration and congress have taken things to an unprecedented level.  I often wonder where all of the Ron Paul/smaller government supporters on reddit have gone when it comes to this topic. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;As you can probably conclude, that the 'core' of what is called the conservative 'base' of this country comprise of people of social conservatives. newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps you are right.  But people who identify themselves as libertarians are much closer to the conservative philosophy than the current philosophy of the democrat party fiscally speaking.  And there are some, including myself, who could quickly identify with libertarians if they weren't so overtly weak on national defense. newlinechar  newlinechar For me conservatism means the least amount of government intervention as possible.  With this argument, you can see that I would fall in line with many libertarian's ideals.   newlinechar  newlinechar The word conservative has been tainted lately due to various factors.  I truly believe that many people who argue against the entire ideology really don't know what it stands for.

I have heard the Council of Nicea is where the modern Christian Bible was assembled from the OT and a selection of the various books written for the NT. Can you tell me about the books not selected?

It is argued Josephus' writings about Jesus specifically were placed 200 years after his death and that other writings just refer to the Christ, the anointed one, not necessarily Jesus.

Oh, it was shrewd. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Attaching the confidence flag on every single bill to extort the support of the LPC because the party would be faced with supporting the bill or going to an election they couldn't afford and weren't likely to win was definitely shrewd. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It was also unprecedented and decidedly undemocratic.

There are 7 pedals on a 'standard' harp (harps without pedals aren't really used anymore), each connected to a pitch class (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). Each pedal has three positions - Flat, Natural, and Sharp. So for example, if you push the 'G' pedal all the way down, setting it into the 'sharp' position, all the G strings on the harp have now become G#. You can't tune individual strings and fast chromatic passages are nearly impossible (I hesitate to say 'impossible' because who knows what some people are capable of).

It is of course advantageous from the larvae's perspective to allow and even encourage the caterpillar's survival.

Before cameras, people had an entire room built in every house specifically for the purpose of hosting a service for their dead. People died a lot back then. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In modern homes and apartments, the living room has replaced the old fashioned parlor.[citation needed] In the 19th century, the parlor was the room in the house where the recently deceased were laid out before their funeral. This became the more affirmative term 'living room' in the 20th century. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_room

&gt; Can we just decide to agree that both are useful? newlinechar  newlinechar I can't agree that both are useful in mutually exclusive ways. People in the business of deployment like to talk about unforseen issues. However, those issues are unforseen, because they never did the academic inquiry to begin with. newlinechar  newlinechar That is to say, deployment puts the burden of thought and computation on trial and error; this is great for making incremental improvements to existing technology, but poor at giving us well-understood and major advancements.
There's an option in NoScript called 'Temporarily allow top-level sites by default.' Basically, it'll allow scripts for the domain of the page you're actually looking at, but block all (non-whitelisted) third-party scripts. The result is that 99% of the time the page you're looking at is functional by default but you're spared from most advertising, a large class of XSS attacks, and all those fancy-but-useless flash and javascript widgets that people litter everywhere, slowing everything down. newlinechar  newlinechar I use that and AdBlock plus. Like you, I'm not concerned about security, but I don't have the fastest computer in the world, so clearing all the crap away saves a noticeable amount of time, bandwidth and frustration.
Unfortunately, nominating a judge with a 'balanced viewpoint' comes at the cost of overall balance in the court.  If you think the Republicans are going to be looking for the same compromise when they get back in power, you're in for a surprise.

But caterpillars don't really have blood vessels, rather they have a single fluid filled chamber with a single artery running the length of the body to circulate this fluid. As I understand it, the skin itself is all that holds the blood inside. This was shown well in the animation. Now, if they formed cysts as you describe, that would prevent bleed out, but the explanation stated the larvae fed on the hemolymph. I don't see how they could do this if they weren't bathed in it as the animation showed, and in that case I don't understand how the caterpillar didn't bleed out. Is the issue that the hemolymph is thick enough?
Amazing Grace was written by a slave trader who repented his lifestyle and little by little started to oppose slavery. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is what whites think of as the preferred hymn of black people, but it's part of a stereotype. Sure it's well known, Amazing Grace is just as if not more popular and more well-known. I'm speaking as a black person, not as a person who references Wikipedia religiously.
24 minutes later I did the same.

Great? No. In my sane state of mind, my morals can't be moved; they are, along with my actions, what define me. In an altered state of mind (drunk or high) I don't know what could happen, so I've forsaken drugs of any kind should the worst occur while I'm under the influence. I've never hurt anyone, including myself, so I seriously don't understand your point.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think you misunderstand the 'urge' (serial killer have those, they literally can't go a long time past their last kill) with being attracted. There is no impulse to not be acted upon. newlinechar  newlinechar Think about it this way. A young man sees a young woman pass in front of him and he finds her attractive, do you think he has to supress his 'impulse' to rape her? No, right? OK, now replace hot woman with girl. That's my situation. I don't differentiate between ages, not that I'm attracted to little girls exclusively.  newlinechar  newlinechar I can admit I am fucked (though, through no fault of mine), I can admit my thoughts are unconventional and disgusting to some, but above all of that I can admit that I won't hurt anyone. It's just not me. Get it? Got it? Good.

Crazy biology student theory: newlinechar  newlinechar Women seem to only be physically attracted to men on a part-time basis. The unconscious primate mind is constantly evaluating men for other standards of fitness. Part of it is gleaned from the perception of other men and women. newlinechar  newlinechar Hence, some women have a need for men to at least have the opportunity to philander. Some women actually have an unspoken requirement for their partner to be promiscuous. In some relationships, it is possible to have sex with many women, provided each (or the) persistent partner believes that your provider relationship is exclusively focused on them. newlinechar  newlinechar Nature doesn't care about 'fair.' Most primates are promiscuous, and depending on the species that can mean either gender or both. We all have over-sized sex organs for a reason. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you both work?  What are you bringing to the table lately?  One alternate goal is to be a big fish in a small pond.  Do you have any hobbies?  Your male friends figure into her evaluation of your community status.  If you are perceived as a leader or a goto person in any context, it ought to bolster your social status even if she complains about bowling night. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, how long have you been married?  Partnering past breeding age is an anomaly in biological history.  There's no playbook in nature's handbag once your offspring have grown beyond their immediate need of you, which is about eight years, and right about time for most primates to kick the bucket.  That's when the oxytocin shuts off.  For any existence medical science has encouraged beyond that, we're just inventing the sociology as we go.

Very good question! There are a bunch of things, so I'm going to list you a whole nice meal that would be easy to make, in probably about an hour and will certainly impress your friends / date / whoever: newlinechar  newlinechar Start off with a homemade vinaigrette on a few sprouts (Can easily find in almost any market) with some beef carpaccio dressed with a little of the oil you used for the vinaigrette. SUPER EASY TO DO.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then as a cleanser I like to use grapefruit sorbet, but if you don't have an ice cream maker, it's more trouble than it's worth. newlinechar  newlinechar Then, pretty much anything stuffed is a great way to show people you have chops, since it's often conceived as something harder than it is (No idea why). I like to do prosciutto wrapped chicken breasts with a spinach / cheese stuffing. Drizzle a little olive oil over the breasts and top with a bay leaf pop into the oven and you're done. newlinechar  newlinechar Then to finish, peach melba. Nothing gets a girl hotter than a nicely done peach melba.  newlinechar  newlinechar And the best part? You could probably do all of this for about $35-50 depending on where you shop. A lot cheaper than a fancy restaurant. newlinechar  newlinechar If there's interest I can write up a nice tutorial on how to do this meal.

You're right about that.

I am more into 12-14 year olds which is not exactly something I can just flat out tell people. newlinechar  newlinechar And the pedophilia itself feels very fake.

you're making my point.  The 2nd Amendment contains vague language--it also mentions something about a militia, if I recall correctly.

Although to be honest, he seemed like a very nice individual, but his 'character' is ridiculous and has influenced a lot of chefs to act the wrong way in the kitchen to their staff, it's ridiculous how some people think they are Ramsey and can berate their employees to their heart's content. Fuck that guy. newlinechar  newlinechar Thomas Keller - Good guy, thinks a bit highly of himself. newlinechar  newlinechar Nigella Lawson - I would marry this woman. :( newlinechar  newlinechar Morimoto - I like him, he's quite a character!

In my experience Audio has always worked with almost no effort.  Multiple monitors worked, to a point.  Either both monitors had to have the same vertical size or they'd scroll, or one couldn't move a window from one screen to another.  And there were not standard utilities to deal with it, only nvidia's tool would work. newlinechar  newlinechar I've never seen (as in been able to purchase) a wireless-G or better card that didn't need NDISwrapper help to work. newlinechar  newlinechar In summary, audio good, wireless workable with hacks, and multi-monitor support needs some work.
I'm with Beriadan. The blog post says users are doing it wrong. In my opinion, those few notification icons use a unique interface design, which throws off everyone who is used to right-clicking a file icon for operations on it. So the interface is inconsistent, not the users. newlinechar  newlinechar Another problem users have with the notification icon is double clicking (maybe pre-XP, I haven't tried lately), which brings up the expert mode. Because you have to double click a file icon to get it to do anything, some users do the same thing with the notification icons. I had to tell one user about 4 times to single-click the icon, which he would promptly double click out of habit.

I have a problem with your argument because your are twisting nikilli words to meet your own agenda. No where did he say that all Jews support Israel and he hated Israel. He just does not like powerful influences controlling washington policy and they happen to be Jewish and support Israel.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I find it interesting that you want to focus other than Israel when in fact, Israel (via AIPAC) plays a big part of our middle east policy- one of the big reasons we went to war in Iraq. As for the oil lobby that argument is sooo damn old- it is lame. Only until recently did oil companies even suggest that they would consider investment in Iraq given the better security situation at present (but hardly from normal). For quite some time, they did not want to have anything to do with Iraq because the investment was not secure. This same situation applies everywhere around the world- if instability or guerilla warfare, you can bet that oil companies will either shut down or leave.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You really should pay attention to what he says especially here: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar *Obviously, all Jews are not to blame for this. But there is a minority within, a group of racist Jews, who can and do direct this nation to do its bidding. They are in part successful at this effort because so many of you are so afraid of directing criticism at anyone who is Jewish because, again, of the fear of being accused of being anti-Semitic.* newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

Weak. When was this guy around, like 150 years ago? Kurzweil hadn't discovered the law of accelerating returns yet.  newlinechar  newlinechar Data in biological databases is growing exponentially with an average doubling time of _1.2 years_, that's much faster than Moore's law, which operates at ~1.8 years. The LHC will gather 15 petabytes of data every year. That's probably more than 6 orders of magnitude more data than Faraday gathered in his entire lifetime, which was all he could base his scientific discoveries on. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure our views of science are incomplete _now_. This is obvious by all the things we know we can't explain (probably a small subset of the things we don't even know we can't explain). But the point of exponential returns is that we can asymptotically approach a complete account of nature.

Jewish dominance in the film industry has a simple explanation: the Jewish mafia. newlinechar  newlinechar The American movie theater is the most excellent kind of money laundering machine there is.  It is cash only.  And you can claim to sell as many tickets as you'd like, and no one will ever know you're lying. newlinechar  newlinechar So, you're in the Jewish mob, and you want to launder some of cash you've made from dealing drugs.  You buy into Hollywood.  At first you do this to launder cash, but after a time, it becomes profitable in its own right. newlinechar  newlinechar The Jewish mafia used the flow of money it laundered through the American movie industry to buy into it, and eventually, to dominate it. newlinechar  newlinechar There are of course many Jewish filmmakers who are where they are because of merit.  For instance, anybody who doubts Steven Spielberg's creds need only look at _Duel_, and marvel at how brilliant a movie that was for a young filmmaker to make. newlinechar  newlinechar But we have lots of shit in the movie industry today too.  Almost all of it has a Jewish name at the top of the credit roll.  This isn't an accident. newlinechar  newlinechar Jews are no better than anyone else at making movies.  They only have enjoyed greater opportunity to do so.  How they got there isn't exactly elegant, but that isn't really important. newlinechar  newlinechar What's important is that we understand how Jewish domination over the movie industry has translated into Jewish domination over the news.  I could give a fuck who makes the next Batman movie.  But who gets to decide how the next Israeli atrocity against the Palestinians people is reported to the American public, well you better believe that interests me. newlinechar  newlinechar It should interest you too.

&gt;These powerful people will have a good time no matter the direction of social change. Good or bad, they will have it good for them. This power structure is far more dominant than any nation on earth because the people running it are the ones that own the people that run nations and the people that inform the masses. newlinechar  newlinechar They have people set up to take the fall. The real controllers are nearly invisible... and if you believe in 'aliens' or 'demons' then the ones at the top really are invisible. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There are those of us that are out there that prefer 'the fight' and cannot see beyond their own feelings of 'injustice' or insecurity. People that feel victimized manipulated and betrayed by the very power structure I refer to. They would kill first and ask questions later.   newlinechar  newlinechar The only argument I can think of to defend the controllers is: once you target someone for 'justice' you open yourself up to someone else targeting you for justice. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The power structure of the 'dominant' could just as easily bring freedom and prosperity as it can bring control and destruction. Maybe this power structure of the super wealthy individuals and families isn't as much about power as it is impaired by the attempts of a 'fear class' or 'victim class' to punish and or control them. newlinechar  newlinechar I think this paragraph speaks for itself. A control grid run by elites can bring freedom and prosperity; deposing tyrants is unfair to the tyrants. newlinechar  newlinechar The only justification I can make for the controllers is that I myself don't want to be in a position to be lynched, especially for a crime someone like me (but not actually tied to me) committed.

The fundamental reason why any given state of quality of socialized healthcare is not sustainable in the long run, is the fact that it is an attempt at denying the real-world causal relationship between an individual's actions in their physical environment and their personal health and well-being. newlinechar  newlinechar What I mean by this is that socialized healthcare prevents an individual from personally experiencing the cause and effect laws of his own actions. Like it or not, all human action, and hence all human reality, stems from individual minds. newlinechar  newlinechar By socializing the costs of healthcare through a coercive, governmental form of social contract, what happens is that the individual finds that his actions do not affect his own person in the same way as they would if healthcare were private. He thus learns and adapts into being a person whose natural self-serving interests are at conflict with other people's self-serving interests, a conflict which would not exist if healthcare were totally privately run. In the latter case, people's self-interests would harmonize and fit together like a puzzle. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, socialized healthcare is based on egalitarian philosophy. Egalitarian philosophy is terrible for humans, but I will not go into that here. I will simply use socialized healthcare as an example, since it is relevant. In egalitarian, socialized healthcare, to make something free to the individual and chargeable to the group as a whole, is to make the consumption of the individual virtually costless, both to himself and to every other individual. newlinechar  newlinechar When visits to doctors are made free to the individual and chargeable to the taxpayers collectively, then each individual perceives the benefit of his going to a doctor, while he and every other taxpayer experiences a personal cost equal to the cost of the visit divided by the number of millions of taxpayers. In such circumstances, every individual is encouraged to take advantage of the situation and, as a result, the overall cost to everyone actually ends up greatly increasing. newlinechar  newlinechar In efforts to control costs, the government ends up actually opposing advances in medical technology. It comes to regard such procedures as the implantation of artificial hearts as a major threat to its budget. This is with good reason, since, by the logic of socialized medicine, everyone who needs it is entitled to demand a procedure as soon as it becomes recognized as practicable. The result of this is that the normal, free-market incentives which work to reduce costs before something becomes available to a mass market are not present under socialized medicine. newlinechar  newlinechar Since our economy has another form of government intervention, namely in money and credit, what happens is that this inflation makes the costs continually rise every year. Since there is very little if no free markets in medicine, which always acts to lower prices, what happens is that over time, the costs become so high for the government that they have to cut back on its benefits. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the slow deterioration of the quality of healthcare in Canada that I am talking about.

I wasn't feeling judgmental at all, and was of the same frame of mind as you about Paedo until he tried to justify the fact that he is nurturing these thoughts and actually acting on them by putting himself in a position to be around children, actually speaking to their parents, etc. That is allowing the thoughts to nurture, and his justification may be elastic enough to encompass actual sexual contact with a child later, when his desires are being fed this way. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no justification for sexual relationships with children. It is intrinsically wrong, it is detrimental for the children, and there is no such thing as a consensual sexual relationship between an adult and a child. In our country, child has been defined as anyone under the age of 18, to be safe, but we all know that there is a gray area between I'd say, 16-18. Prepubescent children, like the ones Paedo is attracted to, are unarguably off limits to sexual contact with adults, and should stay that way.

&gt; In our country, child has been defined as anyone under the age of 18 newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, in most of the northeast, the age of consent is 16 (the exception is New York where it's 17). newlinechar  newlinechar That aside, I do think it's important to make a distinction between 'children' and sexually active teenagers, and not use the word 'child' to refer to the latter in this context, whatever the law is.  The law doesn't refer to them as 'children' either, it just states what numeric age someone can legally consent to sex at. newlinechar  newlinechar The conflation between children and late-teens takes discussions like this off course a lot.  It also has some terrible ramifications for the teens themselves, such as the recent spate of high school students being registered as sex offenders for sharing sexy cell phone photos of themselves with their friends, or the 17 year old in Georgia who got sentenced to 10 years in jail after a 15 year old girl gave him a blow job at a party - a blow job she initiated (Georgia's age of consent is 16).

There are two main languages that I'd recommend for a beginner looking to get into programming. You can either go the mainstream way (Java) which is the first language taught in most universities, or you can go a somewhat more practical language that might actually be useful for scripting stuff around your computer (Ruby). Also Ruby is really trendy these days, which will make you cool.  newlinechar  newlinechar For java, do this: newlinechar  newlinechar Download [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/ganymede/SR2/eclipse-java-ganymede-SR2-macosx-carbon.tar.gz) for java, its a good, free Integrated Development Environment, which has some nice features (or you could use xcode if you have a mac, or a number of other IDEs and editors for lots of platforms)  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, after you get that start reading [The Sun Java Tutorial](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/), This is a really good tutorial for beginning with java, I used it most when I was learning java for the first time and actually found it more useful than the books for the class. newlinechar  newlinechar For ruby, do this: newlinechar  newlinechar You might need to download ruby and install it (for PCs, Macs have it already) to get it go here http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ newlinechar  newlinechar They have a great little tutorial to get started on their site, it explains the very very basics of ruby. Then start learning more in depth from the funniest programming book ever [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://poignantguide.net/ruby/) Its a comic book programming book and its actually a kinda funny read, but teaches you programming well.  newlinechar  newlinechar For java, do this: newlinechar  newlinechar Download [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/ganymede/SR2/eclipse-java-ganymede-SR2-macosx-carbon.tar.gz) for java, its a good, free Integrated Development Environment, which has some nice features (or you could use xcode if you have a mac, or a number of other IDEs and editors for lots of platforms)  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, after you get that start reading [The Sun Java Tutorial](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/), This is a really good tutorial for beginning with java, I used it most when I was learning java for the first time and actually found it more useful than the books for the class. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Most of all, just lurk on the /r/programming they have fun articles there and usually its not super important to know the language really well to get the concepts they talk about.  newlinechar

You might also try talking to a Priest, even if you aren't Catholic. It has been my experience that Priests have a lot of wisdom about these matters and have devoted themselves to the faith in ways that other religions don't demand. As such, many of them have dealt with this issue of dryness in prayer, lack of emotional connection to God and could help you see things in a new light. This is not to disparage clergy of other faiths, of course. I've just been helped more by Priests than other people of faith.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I would also suggest that you keep going to church. If your wife is Christian, you could be headed for a breakup if you decide that 'God is not for you.'  This is practical advice more than anything, however. I mean, my SO loves opera and I have to sit through it nearly weekly in some form or other, so maybe going to Church could be just an expression of love and support for your wife. You have time to decide how you feel about God and what you believe, so don't make things more complicated by stopping Church attendance.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar P.S. newlinechar  newlinechar I rarely had great depth of feeling for God during prayer until I started going to Catholic Church. I loved God in vague way before, and prayed because it helped me, but I didn’t have deep emotional experiences or feel an amazing connection to God until I started going to Catholic Church. I guess what I am saying is that you might want to seek a new demonization. Maybe God is holding back certain experiences from you because you are in the wrong place. Whatever the case, talk to clergy you trust and don’t think that because you haven’t had certain experiences yet that it means you can’t or never will. Life is a journey, not a destination.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 
Exactly. Morality is simply game theory. You behave, because if you didn't have to behave, no one else would have to either, and you'd face similar horrible consequences.

One of the very few submissions of yours I voted up. 
As a former waitress and bartender, I'm going to have to side with the waitress on this one. It's unbelievably easy to mistype on the touchscreens, especially when it's busy and you are in a hurry. It happened quite frequently at the restaurant I worked at. People would call and say they were mischarged, the manager would send them a gift certificate, and that was that.  newlinechar  newlinechar One waitress actually did lose her job over an identical situation. It was Memorial day, the restaurant was full, and there were only 2 servers on. The one server (who had 11 tables at the time) overcharged the patron by $4, and the patron called absolutely furious when he received his credit card bill. He demanded that the waitress be fired. She even offered to pay for his entire bill out of her pocket ($40 something).  newlinechar  newlinechar She called me (a supervisor) crying. I was so disgusted at the situation that I walked out. 
Absolutely, I wish we could do that. Unfortunately, the outcome would most likely be that people either just decided they didn't want a dog (too much work to learn about them!) and then we would have even more homeless dogs and underground breeding.

This is a question I get quite often, and the answer is I would absolutely not go on one of those shows. And frankly, they wouldn't take me, I am too accomplished.  newlinechar  newlinechar The short answer is that: They do not hire REAL chefs, they hire people who THINK they are chefs. One of the poxes of this industry is people move up way too fast and then coast until they die, no longer learning. You need to move up gradually, learning every single day, and then you will have enough knowledge and confidence that you won't mind continuing to learn in your profession, which is best.  newlinechar  newlinechar Many of the people who move up to fast often stop learning because they find one way to do something, and think it is the ONLY correct way because they are unwilling to learn once they've hit their plateau. newlinechar  newlinechar tl ; dr - They are not good at cooking.

Okay! newlinechar Thats a lot of pig there, but I personally would fry up that bacon really nice and crispy and shred / crumble it and mix it with some wilted spinach, mushrooms, onions and some lemon juice (seems odd, but trust me) Stuff that mixture right up into that nice lion you got and tie it off. Sear on the grill (if you want ;)), switch off one side of the grill and put the loin onto the non-heated side of the grill on top of tin foil but keep the other side on. After about 30-40 minutes or so, take it out and pour that nice juice you have in the foil into a pan, pour in a bit of cognac and thicken it up with a little flour/butter (roux) and you've got a nice sauce.

No problemo! You're keepin' it alive, my friend! newlinechar  newlinechar If you just say 'my compliments to the chef' it will rarely if ever get to me, there's just too much going on. Sometimes a waitress will drop that in as they come to pick up food, but usually they have too much on their mind to remember it. newlinechar  newlinechar I do go out to the floor and talk to patrons at least once a night so that I can get a good idea of my customer base, ask them what they'd like to see on next months menu, etc all that good stuff. I like to have a very personal atmosphere in the restaurant so they don't resent me for charging them through the roof.  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, if you want to drop a nice tip, what you could do is tip the waitress and set aside a second tip and say 'I'd like this to go to the kitchen staff', because depending on how the restaurant does their tips, all tips are shared usually, but a little extra gesture to personally tip the kitchen staff makes us feel super special. As for just general tips for being a good patron, don't yell out after the waitress if you want something. A subtle, raised hand as you make eye contact is more than sufficient and much more polite.  newlinechar  newlinechar If something is not what you ordered, or something that is cooked wrong, etc, politely mention to the waitress what the problem is, and just ask nicely for the correction. This is the biggest mistake I find people make. **I HAVE NEVER AND WILL NEVER SPIT IN FOOD, AND NEITHER DOES ANYONE IN MY RESTAURANT** But I do resent you and get a little angry if you are very vocal and upset about something that **I** passed and usually it's a mistake on your end. However, if you just say it politely and it comes back for a simple reason I will usually be much more willing to do something about it for you. Niceness goes a very long way in service.  newlinechar  newlinechar - I think I should explain what I meant about getting angry and resenting you. What I meant by that is I am upset when food comes back because I passed it to the waitress, and I am very protective of my food, and 99% of the time I will not let it pass if it is not good. And what you're saying is you know how to cook it better than I know how to cook it if you are getting very upset and vocal about it.

I'm going to agree with you on the Dwarf Fortress.  I think the Dwarf Fortress designer didn't understand the ASCII limitation and went crazy.  As a result, I couldn't enjoy it at all.  The thing that killed it for me was not the monsters-as-letters problem, but the interface.  I couldn't understand why I had to hit ESC to get out of some menus and space bar to get out of the others, and none of the menu choices made any intuitive sense to me.  I like to learn new things, but Dwarf Fortress is just extremely overwhelming.  I felt like I had to have a 10 hour study session to get even the minimum fun from the game and that's too much, IMO.  I was watching youtube DF tutorials just to get started and after 1 hour I couldn't even build the basic dungeon.  So I gave up.

Actually, I'm VERY familiar, as I'm a librarian. However, you may (or may not) be familiar with the recent Emerald journals scandal (publishing the same article in multiple journals).

Sorry, but that's a completely false statement. Picture these two scenarios: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Would you agree to make $8k a month by monitoring an off-shore platform system in the middle of the sea, without any kind of internet/communication available, for 6~8 months a year? I wouldn't, too much hassle. If you say you would, picture what things you need/really like in your life and what would it be if they were taken off of you, for example losing touch with your family/friends, going to a place with a completely different eating style (and no McDonalds, nor starbucks), not having internet, working in a very unhygienic place, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar 2)Imagine if I told you that you could make 2 grand each week by performing a normal 8 to 5 job, but you won't receive any payment for the first 6 months. You'll even have to work your ass off the first 6 months, because what they do  during those months determine if you'll make 2 grands a week or $200 a month from then on. I can imagine many MANY people wouldn't do that. Add another variable, assume you'd have to PAY for the first 6 months, and then you'll earn the money, and probable even less people would do it. Now, finally remove completely the 'normal 8 to 5 job' and change it for an 'all day and night job with no particular time pattern, you just have to do what you have to do whenever it's required'. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I smile when people ask themselves why can't we all have a successful enterprise and make a lot of money. Most people rationalize that 'it's difficult to make a succesful enterprise, so I risk losing all my money'. That's a wrong statement. Making a succesful enterprise is not difficult from an execution point of view. You just have to have the mentality that your income will directly and exponentially depend on your effort. newlinechar  newlinechar People who say they could do #1 will probably have the skillset to become succesful managers. As such is the mindset of 'sacrificing personal space in order to increase your job value'. newlinechar  newlinechar People who think they could do #2 are welcome to join us, entrepreneurs! There are great satisfactions if you're willing to put your effort there. newlinechar  newlinechar Sadly (or fortunately, depending which side of the coin you're looking at), most people wouldn't have the willpower to do either, I know I couldn't sacrifice my personal life for a management position, but I'm more than willing to play the game (Damn, I lost the game :( ). newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Typo

I love it! And they are a bit too apologetic about it, it's fine the first time and I always laugh politely, but my girlfriend still does it occasionally and I just shoot her a look at this point and she knows. Never apologize for your cooking, you should be happy with what you are cooking. Confidence in your food is one of the best things to do. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said earlier, the meal starts in the mind. How would you feel if the chef of the restaurant came out and said 'Hey, I know guys... sorry, not as good as ______ could do!'. Starting off a meal saying this food isnt the best already puts me in a certain frame of mind.

No no no, many of the chefs on TV try to hide their dish in sauce if it's a show for people like mom, dad, etc who are looking to cook a good meal for their families, etc. Often the meat ISN'T the main attraction in that dish, because they are trying to teach them about cooking. The meat will be overcooked, or dry, or something of that nature and there needs to be room for error, that's where the sauce comes in. If that makes sense.

I'm certainly not insulted, and anyone who actually would dress their child as hitler needs to be lit on fire.
Sure, but again, most of us assume that when we enter into a relationship the natural process of aging won't be our undoing. And would it then be explained and understood by a child that when they reached adulthood, they'd no longer be attractive to their 'partner' and as such, left? Hell, no one would ever tolerate such a thing and if a child was mature enough to enter a relationship, they'd decline those terms as well and if they accepted them, then they are obviously not old enough to make such choices.

I've never been married, but I did a project/presentation on polyamory (not an expert in any way, grain of salt, etc...). If your significant other enjoyed something you didn't, would you object to them finding other people to do it with? For instance, if they enjoyed walking outdoors - would you object to them joining a walking group? newlinechar  newlinechar Sex is not walking, and a polyamorous relationship does need rules and boundaries and trust. But if she's willing to let you satisfy your needs, it may actually make your relationship stronger by focusing not on the things she doesn't offer you (sex), but the things she does. Assuming that your relationship is strong; if it's not, then you have bigger things to worry about. newlinechar  newlinechar I would definitely sit down with her and figure out where she's coming from and why she feels the need to offer this now.

I quoted an excerpt elsewhere that merely saying something Christians disagree with, especially in the context of teaching secular material, is not at issue. newlinechar  newlinechar Eg: newlinechar  newlinechar T: 'The world is approximately 4.5 billion years old.' newlinechar  newlinechar S: 'No, the Bible tells me it's only 6000 years old.' newlinechar  newlinechar T: 'You're free to believe as you choose, but this class adheres to the findings of modern science, and so you'll be required to know the age as it's scientifically understood.' newlinechar  newlinechar The problem was that the teacher's statement did not have any overarching secular purpose, but instead represented a religious viewpoint, and so failed the three-prong Lemon test. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.ocregister.com/newsimages/2009/05/01/Student%20lawsuit%20-%20final%20ruling.pdf newlinechar  newlinechar Page 8: 'Thus, Corbett’s in-class opinions on various social or political issues not  newlinechar touching upon religion do not violate the Establishment Clause, regardless of  newlinechar whether those of a particular religious faith might disagree with or find his  newlinechar statements offensive.  Therefore, any of Corbett’s statements which do not touch  newlinechar upon or mention religion satisfy the Lemon test and do not violate the  newlinechar Establishment Clause. ' newlinechar  newlinechar I recommend reading through the ruling. The judge is in fact incredibly tolerant towards Corbett, finding that in most cases, his statements were either secular in nature or permissible within their context of discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Similarly, it appears that Corbett’s referral to religion as “irrational” had the primary effect of demonstrating how religion can be used as a manipulative tool.12  (See Farnan’s Ex. A, p. 24.)  It is not improper for an AP European History teacher to discuss how religion can intersect with social and political choices.' newlinechar  newlinechar and newlinechar  newlinechar 'These statements cannot be reasonably construed as primarily disapproving of  newlinechar religion.  Corbett explicitly states that he is not drawing a causal connection but  newlinechar merely pointing out a correlation.  The statement that there is a correlation between church attendance and crime rates is an interesting sociological fact appropriate for a college level discussion and seems to only suggest disapproval of religion by way of speculation or inference.' newlinechar  newlinechar Onto pages 26-28 he discusses Corbett's discussion of religious belief about the Sun &amp; Earth, versus our scientific understanding. So even though he's directly confronting traditional Christian beliefs, the judge finds that these statements had merit in a classroom for the sake of discussion of history. newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, it looks like the plaintiff's lawyers exaggerated just how good this ruling was for them. They won, partially, on only a single statement. The school was absolved, and the rest of the statements were ruled as non-infringing. newlinechar  newlinechar Whoever above made antagonistic statements against this judge is clearly ignorant. This judge has thought this matter through carefully, displayed his reasoning very clearly, and erred very much on the side of free academic discussion, only finding that Corbett stepped over the line once, when he said of creationist beliefs that they are 'religious, superstitious nonsense.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

The problem we have in the society is that pay scale and job security have become divorced from performance especially at high level positions. The invention of money was an attempt to standardize everyone's worth to the society. The problem is that money has a cumulative effect and inheritance seriously skews the picture for the next generation. Thus after a few iterations you end up with a system that is far from a meritocracy. Essentially you have foxes guarding the hen house. Rich executives and generally higher management ensure their own job safety at the expense of subordinate employees.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is unsurprising given the way we have structured our society but it is highly unoptimized. For a start inheritance would have to disappear. Next, we would have to have money that describes a person's worth through more than one metric. Maybe as multidimensional money. Where on each axis (dependability, hard work, inventiveness, effectiveness, environmental neutrality) you have a different level of pay. A society is a very complex structure. To have a system of a single marker that shoehorns everything into one number (your salary) makes this system suboptimal. There is probably a better way of renumeration using a more sophisticated model. I think... newlinechar  newlinechar

Yeah, I thought it lost a lot of luster once they brought in Melo and Near to resolve the case, it seemed like they were just milking the series after that point.

It's not an issue of the rule of law exactly but rather a human rights issue on the freedom of religion. newlinechar  newlinechar In the case that they reference in the story from a while back (a criminal case), the woman was required to remove the hijab because the court found that her religious beliefs were not strong enough to warrant her insisting upon wearing it.   newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know the specific facts but I seem to recall that she went out in public without it so it was hard for her to maintain that she was entitled to that right. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not really sure how I feel about any of this which is why I posted it.  I'm still working through my views on the hijab and all of the various issues: feminism, ethnocentrism, freedom of religion, right to confront your accuser.

I know it's bad form to reply to one's own post, but I would like to keep the summary separate from implementation details, suggestions, etc.  Let me elaborate a bit on what I'm thinking here. newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of CS majors are 'overeducated', in the sense that their day job requires a tiny fraction of the knowledge and skills that they have collected.  Hobby projects are often a fun way to actually use this, however the most interesting ones seem to be very time consuming to set up.  Reducing time/effort/knowledge barriers to make non-professional exploration of the boundaries of CS might allow more individuals to become involved, and increase the satisfaction associated with it in the process. newlinechar  newlinechar I would like to be able to log onto this site, find interesting problems (or solutions looking for a problem!), chat about them, etc.  If an idea strikes, I should be able to download a 'problem set' from the site and quickly start hacking on a potential solution.  It should be easy for me to share my partial/final solutions with everyone to be discussed, rated, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar What could the problem sets contain to facilitate this?  As I see it, the most important thing is 'batteries included' - minimal effort required on the part of the participant other than writing the algorithm itself.  Some things the problem set might have: newlinechar  newlinechar * Description of the problem, including comments, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar * Data sets related to the problem. newlinechar  newlinechar * Test harness, useful libraries, etc for the problem in whatever languages the community wishes. newlinechar  newlinechar * Reference implementation (be faster/better/more robust than this) newlinechar  newlinechar * Standardized graphical/textual 'results' that can be submitted to the website. newlinechar  newlinechar * Generic parameter tuner. newlinechar  newlinechar * Other participant's solutions. newlinechar  newlinechar * Publically available papers in the field. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a lot of diversity in the 'computer geek' crowd - some individuals would just want to chat about potential algorithms, others just want something to code for the evening.  Yet more love the idea of taking a working solution and tweaking it to be even better.  Combining the resources of these differing individuals should, in theory, allow us to create better solutions for things. newlinechar  newlinechar If we're to make a site like this, of course we should try to use as much software as is already available - I'm thinking that something like apt or portage might make sense, though git/mercurial/svn may be useful for various things as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The most important thing, at least to me, would be to get a core set of interesting problems up and to start working on solving them.  Aggregating additional problems after that step should be much easier.  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  I really do need to learn markdown

I specialize in French cuisine, although most of what I do is modernized and brought into the now, but using French techniques and their thinking process a lot of the time.

If homosexuality is a religion, then I guess they could. newlinechar  newlinechar What I don't understand, is that this guy says religion is crap and gets done for it. newlinechar  newlinechar However, numerous politicians (incl Obama), are on record as saying how good religion is, but they're fine. Surely this lemon test should apply when religion is spoken of by a state employees (such as politicians) in a positive way as well as those who refer to it in a negative way?
The same goes for the civilian populace: once they believe that they can realistically destroy a government that has many thousands-of-times the killing power they possess, there is no hope for anyone involved.

Maybe I should clarify:  I wasn't saying that I owe everything I am to the fact that I grew up without video games, or that if you grew up playing video games, you're not going to be a successful and productive citizen.   newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I didn't grow up in a particularly strict household.  The 'no video game' rule was really the only thing that my parents would not compromise on.  Otherwise I was given a lot of freedom over whatever activities I wanted to pursue, and by the time I was in high school, if I'd wanted to get a game system, my parents would have let me (in fact, my younger brother bought one in 10th grade without any issues).  But by that time I had no desire for one, because I was occupied enough with other things.   newlinechar  newlinechar I know that there are plenty of kids who do more than just play video games, but there are also a fair number that don't, and I am sure that I ended up doing a lot more activities growing up without them.

Your kid only has to obey your rules until they're 18. After that, they get to decide for themselves how they want to run their lives. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, of course, a good person is open to trying new things. If your kid says: 'I wanna go without shoes today' and you look outside and it's snowing... maybe you let them do it anyway. They'll learn that their feet get really frikkin' cold without shoes, and are far less likely to object the next time you hand them their shoes. newlinechar  newlinechar Between making sure you're consciously being open to revision of the rules, and making sure that you grant people the freedom to do things differently than you, when said things don't hurt anyone else... you have what I'd call a free society. newlinechar  newlinechar Religion usually implies dogma, and inflexibility even in the face of obvious evidence that your rules are stupid.

Alan Moore said it best about the Ripperologists: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In The Dance of the Gull Catchers Moore reports that he had been drawn into and even obsessed with the particulars of the Ripper crimes. The Ripperologists—or 'Gull Catchers' as he refers to them—are depicted as slightly unhinged men running about with large butterfly nets, chasing details and connections, however tenuous. Initially, Moore observes them from a distance, but eventually—while researching and writing From Hell—he joins them. Moore compares the multitude of increasingly outlandish Ripper theories to a Koch snowflake, where a finite, fixed location, event and era (London, in late 1888) can have an infinite number of nooks and crannies. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Source: Wikipedia newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, this article reminded me of Season 5 of The Wire (the greatest show ever on television).

Saying we should be able to fileshare is not the same thing as saying musicians should work for free.   newlinechar  newlinechar As a filesharer, I don't buy a lot of albums, but I do give the artists that I really appreciate more exposure.  Although I'm stealing their work, I'll end up paying to see their concerts when they come through my city, and it is likely I'll bring along friends who are appreciating their music as well. newlinechar  newlinechar As a musician I feel the same way.  If someone gets a crack at my music for free and is digging it, the most I hope for is that they'll show it to some of their friends.  If they really identify with it, maybe they'll come see a concert.  On the whole though, I'd just like the most people possible to hear my music.  For a while now, bands haven't been making shit off selling albums; might as well have some people hear the music if they aren't gonna pay for it anyway.

- Because they have a profit margin to keep up, they have to make a profit at every single store or they shut it down. newlinechar  newlinechar - They care about money, not customers. newlinechar  newlinechar - Do not hire proper chefs because it's cheaper to hire 19 year olds who don't know shit. newlinechar  newlinechar - Each one of their recipes is scientifcally calculated to give the least amount away for the highest profit margin, so they are often filled with more filler ingredients, like fries and such that are very cheap for the restaurant, and have a high mark-up value. Another example is shrimp and pasta dishes. If you see a restaurant with 3 rice dishes and 3 pastas that's a restaurant trying to save money. newlinechar  newlinechar - A smaller restaurant needs to EARN your business, where as if you go to something you know and trust, and is frankly cheaper then you get off (the chain), so people in restaurants work harder and have much lower profit margins because they NEED the business. A large chain does really not need an individual store, if it doesn't turn a profit in that location, they shut it down. You think the guy who NEEDS your money or he goes bankrupt will work harder than a 19 year old getting paid $9/hr will work that hard for you?

&gt; in a similar way  newlinechar  newlinechar Those Jews that decided to immigrate into a land despite those in that land possibly not wanting them there (they didn't actually know that they were unwanted there, and they only became unwanted a lot later) is quite a lesser evil than persecution -- so your comparison isn't merited. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; That seems to be the situation now. What has changed except for the power of the people who have occupation? newlinechar  newlinechar I strongly contend that the oppression of the Palestinians is nowhere near the persecution suffered by the Jews. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I was thinking more of the English newlinechar  newlinechar If the English had prohibited Jews from entering Palestine -- many of those that did enter would have had to stay in Europe where they would not only be persecuted *horribly* (Far worse than any persecution known by any Palestinian), but also genocided.  So would the English really be doing the world a favor if they had prevented Jewish escape into Israel? newlinechar  newlinechar Note that those Jews had nowhere to go, even the US had closed its doors to Jewish immigration. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; the belief of entitlement newlinechar  newlinechar Zionism is not about entitlement.  Immigrating and setting up a state somewhere necessarily means some natives might be offended -- but its a lesser evil than persecution. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Can any reasonable person not see that as being viewed as being unfair and also not see that the people who were dispossessed might take it badly. newlinechar  newlinechar They were not supposed to be dispossessed. They were supposed to be granted equal rights in a state with the immigrating Jews.  I don't think most people at that time would predict that to be such a huge problem with the natives.

It means that you don't have any money.  There are so many things that you need a car for. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Even people I know that live in downtown (they have a large condo) Chicago have SUVs.  They need it for when family needs to be shown around, one guy uses it to drive from the area he works/lives in to the family business that he also assists with (it is in an area that lacks decent transportation to it). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And if you haven't been to Seattle, the public transportation really, really sucks there.  A 40 minute drive would've taken me 4 hours by bus in Seattle (I know, I looked it up).  It also would've been faster for me to walk to work than take the bus (a bus stop was across the street and i was about 3.5mi. to work). Plus many of the bus routes often stop really early, like at 4:30pm (I never get out of work before 5 or 6). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar To get to the airport, or grocery shop, or anything in Seattle you need a car. newlinechar  newlinechar New York or Chicago or San Fransisco I can see living without one.

&gt; Have you ever actually used C++? newlinechar  newlinechar C++ was my main programming language for more than 10 years. I venture to assert that I know C++ very well, including the Standard library.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Strings were absolutely no problem whatsoever. newlinechar  newlinechar Yep mostly because people know they cannot use C++ for text processing. A 'general purpose' language without e.g. Unicode support is not sufficient any more (yes, I know std::wstring but ...).  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; C++ standard is very strict about performance. Every method has a maximum complexity class, e.g length() is O(1), which more-or-less mandate a particular implementation newlinechar  newlinechar Not for std::basic_string member functions.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; how would varying performance (if it were allowed by the standard) make strings unpredictable and unusable?  newlinechar  newlinechar 1. 'varying performance' is 'allowed' (unspecified) by the Standard.  newlinechar  newlinechar 2. They major problem is copying. You cannot tell without looking at the implementation whether copying a string is very fast (because of 'Small String Optimization' or a reference-counted implementation) or very slow (because the copy constructor always allocates a new buffer). E.g. the Microsoft std::string implementation is fast for (very) small strings but slow for larger. See also: http://www.gotw.ca/publications/optimizations.htm . newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I bet that whatever language you use (with built-in strings., so we're not exactly talking low-level) has enough hidden complexity (GC, JIT, etc) to cause considerable performance swings. newlinechar  newlinechar Quite the contrary. Modern languages use built-in immutable string types which are devoid of such problems.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; On Boost, it provides many, many useful features;  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see anything in Boost that isn't present in other libraries in a more accessible way. Moreover, Boost makes your programs and your compiler messages unreadable causing potential maintenance problems. If I were to select a basic C++ library today I would probably take the now free Qt library (also for non-GUI programming). I would also take a look at Poco [http://pocoproject.org/](http://pocoproject.org/) and Matthew Wilson's libraries http://sourceforge.net/users/matsys/ . newlinechar  newlinechar     newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar    newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar     newlinechar  newlinechar

I agree with this, although I'm not very tall for a women (I come from a very tall family, I'm the shorty at 5'6' and change), I've been with both short and tall men.  I honestly prefer guys to be closer to my height.  Neck cramps suck if the guys are too tall.  Not to mention I have legs that belong on a woman that's 5'9', so my preference of 5'8' to 5'10' men evens out beautifully.  It makes some standing activities very nice, if you get my drift.  My boyfriend who's 5'8' has always ended up with women that are just above 5 foot though... I'm rare for him.  At least he can't use me as a arm rest. Yes I'm taller than him when I wear heels but I could care less. newlinechar  newlinechar I could care less if a man is a boob man, leg men or ass man.  It's all preferences.

I'm not saying that the government will win, just that the rebels/freedom-fighters will create a scenario in which everyone loses.

It's irresponsible to target a specific individual for investigation into his personal life as part of a group assignment for school.  Just as Scalia said, just because you can doesn't mean you should.  And what was gained regarding law education?  I see no legal education that this provided, this seems like a simple publicity stunt for the law professor to get attention for himself, and perhaps make a political point that he's personally interested in promoting, but does nothing else.  I don't agree with Scalia on a lot of things, but I think he's right in this case.

Yeah, it sucks how loneliness eventually makes one unable to care for/look after one's own life, and any sense of being able to affect one's fortune (somewhat paradoxically, it *does* make one 100% self-absorbed). newlinechar  newlinechar But why hope for a soon death? It'll be over too soon anyway, I'm 24 now and the years have been flying by like nothing recently. I'm actually hoping that some sort of miracle will happen before I'm too old :|
Simon Tam? Is that you? :)
Let's break it down to it's simplest. First you do not chose god, God chooses you. Second it is not required for you to feel anything to be saved. It is only required that you believe that Jesus died for your sins.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you have guilt it is only because you DO NOT have a personal relationship with Christ at all and are trying to live 'religiously' without heart, or, as with most, you have not fully taken to heart that you are free from condemnation forever for your sins.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar First, nothing a person does, or does not do, sends them to heaven or hell. Eternal life is determined by only one thing - A personal relationship with Christ. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You cannot, through your feelings, conduct, words or behaviors change your position with God if you are saved. People who struggle with legalism often are trying to achieve forgiveness from God, justification before God, and acceptance by God, through obedience to God. They often end up living lives of bored religious ceremony with absolutely zero fulfillment. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The basics are this. God saw your biggest problem - sin. HE provided the remedy - his son. You had nothing to do with that. We are however present as he draws those he has chosen. Upon the moment one truly, truly is sorry for their sins and trusts in Christ for forgiveness (saved, born again) GOD DECLARES THEM RIGHTEOUS. No sin or lack of feeling or commitment can change that once it has happened. It is in essence a legal declaration by God.That is Justification. It is totally objective. You will never be more or less holy that you were at that moment. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Immediately after that however, you begin the process of sanctification, which is lifelong and highly subjective because it involves you directly. It involves your walk, every day, and it goes up and down. Sometimes you grow fast sometimes slow. Sometimes you feel strong sometimes not. It's irrelevant however to your ultimate status before God. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar From reading your posts either your church is lacking in some way or you have never really been born again. I cannot with certainty know but I can tell you that if you listen to people who boldly tell you to toss it all you will have consequences. If not in this life most certainly when it ends. I can see from your posts that your 'religious' life is highly feelings based. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Find what I would call a 'live' church. Somewhere that preaches the cross and it's impact. If you don't feel like God has any direct affect in your life then get out there and start taking God into others lives by first being around people who do and talking to them about where you are and also serving others for no other reason than for God's sake. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly I am one of those 'after-life' survivors who had many years mocking and living without GOD. My experience to you is not important but it did teach me one thing. People who tell you to quit do not know God period. They think they are so on top of everything but the fact is that God simply has not called them. Most, are not going to ever know, nor even care, that they ever know Christ. As the bible says they are marked for destruction. They are like I was, foolish, prideful, and ignorant. They have great sounding worldly wisdom. They site science, offer seemingly great joys of life without God. Freedom! No guilt! etc. The reality is though that they are in fact slaves to habits that will ultimately condemn them when they die. And both you and they will die because ultimately, as someone once said, 'death is God's limit on man's arrogance'. Once they do it will be to late. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I urge you to stay strong and continue on. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry for my rant. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

I can't help but think the international community is saying to Israel 'if you're not ok with a two-state solution we have an option you're going to hate even more.'  Lets face it Israelis, these people deserve humans rights and not to be treated like cattle.  The sooner you swallow the two-state solution the better off your long term interests are.   newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, as an American who's convinced the average Israeli is a racist bigot, I'd love to see a one-state solution where Jews quickly become minorities and the bizarre notion of a state based for a religion by a religion is quickly relegated to a brief mention in history books.  The same goes for nations by Muslims for Muslims.  No nation should be founded on a particular religion. newlinechar

&gt;Bankers got rich by lending money to the American People by overvaluing their homes and convincing them to take out second mortgages which people then spent on Chinese made junk manufactured by multinational companies using slave-wage laborers driving the US government deep into debt which the Chinese government bought through US Treasury bonds. newlinechar  newlinechar I love the way that the consumer is so often presented as innocent victim in all of this. No-one was forcing them to take out second mortgages and spend them on tat, and no-one was forcing people to buy houses for more than they could afford. newlinechar  newlinechar Last time I moved, I was offered a massive mortgage (and could probably have just about stretched to paying it) and could have bought a fantastic house with that. Instead, I decided how much I was reasonably prepared to pay for a house, and bought the best one I could for that price.

One could argue that if she is unable/unwilling to acknowledge homosexuality as an acceptable behavior, then she is ethically obligated to refer the patient to another counselor in order to keep from allowing her personal values from intruding her professional work. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In other words, while it would certainly be wrong for her to make judgements to her patient about their sexuality in a counselling session, perhaps it's a valid compromise to find her patient a more qualified counselor.

You have to understand, Congress signed off on waterboarding.  If you prosecute the Republicans, you will have to prosecute Nancy Pelosi and some other Democrats.  Which is why no one will be prosecuted.  Right now the Democrats are literally keeping their cake while eating it. They are enjoying the best of both worlds, so don't expect them to follow through on this and commit political suicide. newlinechar  newlinechar You see the Government has these checks and balances in place that require members of both parties on certain committees are informed of all things.  In the case of waterboarding that included Nancy Pelosi.  In fact when truth be known, you would see it wasn't the Bush Administration who came up with waterboarding, it was the CIA, and the CIA asked Congress, not the President.  Bush certainly jumped on the bandwagon, yet he is an idiot so what did everyone expect...  The arm of the government most responsible is Congress.  Then again, that would require people to actually follow the votes, and as has been proven no one really cares about pesky facts like that when attempting to prove one party better than the other.

This is not necessarily true.  You are creating jobs and putting people to work, during WWII everyone was working.  Just because it's called the military does not necessarily mean it's being used for offensive purposes.  Also, considering how much government work is contracted out there is a shit-ton of defense related money going to private companies.  The problem with this is the no-bid contracts and lack of oversight on these contracts.

Which parts of modern copyright laws that Lessig objects to, do you think are good?   newlinechar  newlinechar From what I've seen, he objects to things like indefinite term extensions by Congress, laws like the DMCA, and the attempts at erosion of fair use.   But one of his points is that these over-the-top laws are just creating a backlash - he argues that [here](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/21/larry-lessig-defends-copyright-loves-charlie-rose-remixes/), and expresses concern that abolishing copyright would be wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar So my take is that his perspective seems pretty balanced and reasonable.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for his own stuff, the 'full force of those laws' that he uses would still be available under classic copyright - it's not like he's been issuing DMCA takedown notices. newlinechar  newlinechar I haven't seen him argue that people have an obligation to release their stuff under an open or semi-open license like CC, but rather that there are cases where it makes more sense to do that than to try to strong-arm your customers into paying for your stuff.  Three of the five books on lessig.org right now are available under CC licenses, so he's walking the walk.  Essentially, what he's doing is voluntarily relinquishing some of his rights in a much shorter period of time than copyright law allows for.   newlinechar  newlinechar Seems like you're the one trying to use a misguided obligation argument against Lessig. newlinechar 
From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game\)): newlinechar  newlinechar The origins of The Game are uncertain. One theory is that when two men missed their last train and had to spend the whole night on a platform, they tried not to think about their situation and whoever did first, lost. Another is that it was invented in London in 1996 'to annoy people'. The reported earliest known reference on the Internet is from 2002. The Game is an example of ironic processing, also known as the White Bear Phenomenon, in which attempts to avoid certain thoughts make those thoughts more persistent. A classic example of ironic processing is Dostoevsky's quote: “Try to pose for yourself this task: not to think of a polar bear, and you will see that the cursed thing will come to mind every minute.”

I find all these replies fascinating. Ever since I injured my writing hand just before my final exams I've been writing in capitals (it was easier when using my wrong hand).

I guess I'm lucky in that my exams where all maths and physics and the examiners couldn't care less which style I wrote in, so long as the answers were right.
Because waterborading is NOT defined as torture. The UN treaty states that: *torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental*.  Note it does not say *torture means the following acts: waterboarding, the rack... etc.*. newlinechar  newlinechar While I personally believe it to be torture, the Justice Department and others felt that by providing certain conditions, then there was no 'severe pain or suffering'.

I've had things that might be classified as panic attempts, but I'm not a doctor so I don't know.

You are right, it just seems to me that Republicans want to control whether or not we can get an abortion, get married if we are gay, can get affordable health care, or alternative energy etc. They do promote the freedom to carry a gun though and also the freedom to kill a fag or nigger w/o being charged with a hate crime. newlinechar  newlinechar The Democrats seem to want to promote our freedom to get an abortion if we choose to do so, get married if we are gay, to get affordable health care if we are sick &amp; find alternatives to our oil dependence.

No party is perfect, but the Republican party of the 21st century is less perfect than any other party I can recall, and I'm including the Bull-Moose party, the Whigs, the Green Party, the Reform Party, Lemon Party, Cookie Party, and my little brother's Birthday Party.

That's broken window fallacy thinking. Military production is not an efficient use of resources, if they are not needed, at least. If it weren't for military spending, those resources (physical, labor, and others) could be directed to new innovation. Often in economics, people confuse the map for the territory. newlinechar  newlinechar Keynesian ideas of stimulation rely on people's expectations of expenditure and consumption. Nothing that Keynes wrote says that a large, standing military (as a percent of GDP) is beneficial to the economy, although he would say that a large INCREASE in military expenditure would be beneficial during times of economic recession.

Progressives need to be careful and not get too cocky.  It is early in the political cycle and it is likely that the current Republican meltdown is temporary - and actually necessary for a leader to emerge in the Party.  I would guess that it won't be too long before the Republicans get their act together, find a leader and a message, and regain much of their lost appeal to voters.  Democrats and Progressives need to understand that the current situation is just temporary and that the Republicans may in fact come back even stronger than previous.  Underestimating the Republicans and Conservatives would be a major mistake.

Exactly. It's been my observation that conspiracy theorists have a hard time accepting that the world is largely run by *no one at all*, and that shit just **happens**. Conspiracy theories are a desire to add predictability to the world, the same way our ancestors attributed crop failures, lightning strikes, and disease to supernatural entities. Conspiracy theorists cannot stomach the thought that the economy is simply too large to be steered by any single entity or group, and that we're all basically just along for the ride.  newlinechar  newlinechar GS and the like aren't any more in control of this than anyone else, really.

&gt;But to be serious-minded about this issue, it's possible that torture could save lives, so if torture were banned, people could be condemned to death. I believe it's a genuine ethical dilemma. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, it absolutely is. But in that dilemma, then, should be consideration of how many lives would be saved. After all, we want to sacrifice certain parts of the great way of society that we claim to defend, so we should make sure that the number of lives potentially saved justifies it. newlinechar  newlinechar I just doubt that the number of people we _might_ save from death by use of torture is greater than the number of people we _really would_ save by, for instance, banning smoking and unhealthy foods or developing safer and cleaner cars. This is just like the current Swine Flu hysteria. I'm certain that there is truth to the fact that it could evolve into a pandemic, but it hasn't yet, and half the world is working like crazy to stop the spread of this disease in its tracks. Meanwhile, how many people die of simple stuff, like pneumonia, because their living conditions are way below what we in the western society would ever accept for ourselves? newlinechar  newlinechar This kind of hypocrisy is going on every single day, and it's what's letting us even consider the notion of torture. Of course we should save those 200 people on that plane, but are their lives really worth more effort than the tens of thousands we could save without hurting a single person in any way? newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not claiming anything, I offer no conclusions or solutions to any of this. All I'm saying is that the logic justifying torture is severely flawed. It's fear mongering and panic. We're not scared of HIV epidemics, because we don't live in Africa. We're not scared of working ourselves to death in mines, because we don't live in China. No, we're scared of maybe, possibly, by-pure-chance dying in a terrorist attack along with maybe ten or 100 other people, because we're being told daily that that is a real and existing threat. Of course it is, but is it really more threatening than anything else? Statistically speaking, if you're to endorse torture for any reason, it would be the torture of CEOs in order to make them care more about the well being of their customers, and the heads of states about their citizens. Torturing some lowly terrorist is thinking very, very small.

So was the defense industry.  And so were the banks I suppose.  None of these have the kind of control over the media that Israel seems to enjoy, but more to the point, nobody is afraid of talking about big oil, defense or the banks having a hand in the war on Iraq. newlinechar  newlinechar Israel was well represented in this circle however.  Wolfowitz, Libby, Perle, Kristol, et al.  And of course CNN and The New York Times.  Two very powerful forces suddenly found themselves with a mutual interest and nobody to stand in their way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It would boggle the mind that a country size of Israel has hijacked the USA foreign policy.

Indeed, much of your analysis is dated.  And in any case, if it were as important as you say it is, it only underscores the point that Israel exercises inordinate influence within American government, because surely, our relations with the oil states in the Middle East would be much simpler were Israel out of the picture. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Israel is the USA's unsinkable carrier in the ME. newlinechar  newlinechar A single submarine loaded with cruise missiles could crater those airfields, e.g., sink the carrier.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  They do as they are told. newlinechar  newlinechar That's a nice fairy tale.

I don't know. Directors are normally open minded; to me the Divorce theory is more sound. Marcia Lucas married with him in 69, I don't now the story, but she was the American Graffiti editor. THX is from 71, which she was also was one of the editors, and during their ten years marriage he scripted Star Wars. Is hard to say what input she gave to it, but she edited all Star Wars movies until 83, when she flew away with another guy leaving him and their children. I think that his absence from directing and creating came from it. After reading Steven King's On Writing, is clear the support king's wife gave him, that her reactions to what he had written were more important than anything. I think George lost his North with his wife away to edit his ideas, and maybe it is not his fault. But is just a theory 
Well, it isn't. The only other example I've seen is the state machine example, but as has been pointed out, that's easily implemented using manual trampolining. newlinechar  newlinechar As for writing programs in continuation passing style (which is what the article seems to be talking about) that's just not something that anyone does on a large scale. You only need TR if significant portions of your program are written in CPS, not if you just have an occasional function which takes a continuation argument. newlinechar  newlinechar In a language like Python, tail recursion is a much lower level construct than the looping and iteration primitives the language already provides. There's really very little reason to include it in the language. It wouldn't do any harm, but I've never missed it.

Also, have you ever eaten at *La Grenouille*? I just went there a few weeks ago, and loved it. I had a 3 course meal, and when the first course arrived (an AMAZING salad with a light vinaigrette sauce) I thought I would be hungry afterward. When my plat principal arrived (best piece of meat I've ever had, in an amazing onion sauce) I still thought the same thing. Then, finally, I split a chocolat soufflé, and afterward...I was stuffed. How did they create such a filling meal? I ate next to nothing, yet when I eat a massive hamburger I will still feel hungry. Maybe it was all of that delicious pellegrino, although I usually drink water... newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously though, best meal of my life (so far).

I understand how the human mind will protect itself from ideas that cause it dissonance.  This is why I feel it is a good mental exercise so to speak to challenge ones beliefs on a regular basis.  We all have bias' weather or not we admit it.  Identifying these bias' and confronting them is part of being a critical thinker/skeptic. newlinechar  newlinechar My basic belief of the event is that there was simply massive amounts of arrogance by the US intelligence and law enforcement community, territoriality by different agencies with a fair bit of incompetence due a a lack of accountability.  Not to be a shill or anything, but that's what the commission report, former intelligence officials, and most released memos/documents say.   newlinechar  newlinechar The interesting thing about this 'troll' debate is the fact that I can totally see why people believe/want to believe 9/11 was an inside job without calling them names and marginalizing them (I know this isn't true for all other dubunkers, by each poster should be considered on an individual basis).  Yet people on the other side cannot seem to reciprocate.  Even among poster I consider to be intelligent there is always an air of condescension and suspicions about my motives. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree with you on the fact that LIHOP wouldn't require many people (another thread, another time perhaps).

It's not nearly as easy as you think. newlinechar  newlinechar Most US IX's handle around 1GB/sec (yes, bytes) during an average weekday.  That means that each IX generates no less than 80TB of data daily. newlinechar  newlinechar The fiber equipment alone to transport that much data on a daily basis from ONE IX, let alone the 4-5 majors, is extremely expensive. Even if you wanted to light dark fiber versus lay your own, it's extremely expensive.   newlinechar  newlinechar Probably the most cost efficient method would be to mine data locally at each major IX.  To do that, you need a LOT of computational power at each location.  On top of the dozens of cabinets, replicating a multi-gigabit optical link is not as easy as switch port replication.  A device capable of keeping up with the signaling alone would probably run 6 figures. newlinechar  newlinechar I suppose my point is that, although you're right about the 100% likelihood that this is going on, it is not a cheap operation by any means.

I really don't think it is a matter of this guy being a cop or not. If the judge can't find a proper crime to charge him with, then the guy didn't technically break the law. If the judge charges him with an incorrect crime, than the cop can appeal the decision. The more time the judge takes to make a good decision, the less likely it is for an appeal.

This comic and a few others in the same style and craziness used to be given out at a really popular BBQ restaurant everyone at my private school went to when I was in high school called [Carter Brothers](http://www.carterbrothersbbq.com/).  By the point that I found those, I was an apathetic theist that assumed Jesus could really be the son of God, just by some sort of rationalization like 'all these people can't be completely wrong about all of this can they?'.  Yet after seeing how casually a very popular meeting place can hand out this putrid trash to the people in my community, who I generally considered rather open minded for a small town in NC, I stopped entertaining the idea of Christianity altogether.  Though honestly it was because I was so mad at them for making these.. Now I am an atheist who most certainly doesn't believe in the myth of Jesus Christ just because the facts don't support that claim and it makes more sense that its not real that if it is.

Firstly, empirically they are not treated as civilians.  Secondly, I don't see why anyone would expect them to be, because the exact [definition](http://www.answers.com/civilian) of the word 'civilian' is one who has not taken up arms: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; civilian n. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;A person following the pursuits of civil life, especially one who is not an active member of the military, the police, or a belligerent group. newlinechar  newlinechar While the document itself does not define 'civilian', I don't see how you can argue that a person who is actively and deliberately engaged in combat with a military force is himself a civilian.
I live in southeast NC, and I haven't been able to grow yellow summer squash recently.

It's a matter of self-awareness and recognizing the problem in the first place.  newlinechar  newlinechar The area that *I* have found easiest to improve is the whole 'starting a new hobby' thing. When I want to start a hobby, there's a temptation to go buy all the high-end stuff you need. For example, 'I've always liked photography' means a new DSLR, lenses, filters, bag, and maybe a darkroom.  newlinechar  newlinechar What I've learned to do I learned from my daughter - she's a very talented artist, and she spent a *lot* of time drawing with MS Paint.  newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is - if a hobby is something you're really going to get into, you don't need the high-end tools. You don't need a full art studio to start drawing; you don't need a fully equipped woodshop to start woodworking.  newlinechar  newlinechar So back to my photography example - if a person is serious about taking up photography, an inexpensive digital point and shoot is a fine way to start. Carry it around for a while - if the interest is really there then it'll stick. If, after a few months, there aren't a lot of photos to show for it, then maybe it's a good thing you didn't drop a few thousand dollars on expensive toys.  newlinechar  newlinechar That kind of analysis is how I broke the spell.

I remember learning about how 'I was just following orders' was not a valid excuse when I was a kid. I believed it for a long time, because when people tell you things when you're a kid, you believe them. Now I realize that it's ridiculously simplistic. If you don't follow orders in life, you will quickly be out of a job. If you don't follow orders in war, you may wind up dead and certainly wind up in prison. newlinechar  newlinechar If people spent all their time second guessing their orders, they would have no time to do anything, and no groups could be formed to do anything. newlinechar  newlinechar Disobeying orders and doing the right thing is courageous and heroic. But we shouldn't pretend it's easy to know what's right, or easy to rebuke powerful authority. It's very much open to dispute whether not disobeying orders should be an offense, and it should NOT be open to dispute that being ordered to do something by a powerful authority is a mitigating circumstance.
Living in a community full of religious people, I've noticed that once your friends find out about your non-conformity, most don't really care. As you have both stated, there is also usually a girl that makes it her mission to convert you. In my case it has usually been a girl that has shown romantic interest. I suspect that she believes she can convert you, because she won't date someone who doesn't subscribe to her religious beliefs.

First of all fuck you, you don't know anything about my preconceptions you judgmental prick. I have also never defined marriage as monogamy.

It's not that he has no problem with it.  For god's sake people!

And I like to pretend the first thing I notice is a sense of humor. It isn't. newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly, we are denying billions of years of evolution if we don't admit the the glaring obvious - men are attracted to the female figure and always have been, especially the breast and hips as these are prime indicators of the ability to procreate healthy offspring. There is no shame in it, that is one of the things that drives our procreation - we wouldn't be here as a species without it. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit, and even though I joked about women looking at the wallet first, in reality it isn't a joke. Throughout our specie's history females have looked for strong providers for them and their children. A human female can only have about 1 child a year, we don't produce multiple births with the regularity that other species do. There is a LOT invested in that child, or course she is going to look for a mate that can provide for her and protect her. Again, another reason our species is actually still here.  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course things have changed an awful lot, and for the better, but it would be foolish to pretend we don't still have these instincts on some level.

I'm not even worried so much at the recent 'warmest temps on record'.  We could look at the temp trend between 1940 and 1978 and say the trend of cooling is so obvious there, that it's embarassing to claim that the current period of warming will continue unabated. As recent data shows, such claims are unwarranted as the ice levels this year are approaching their 1979-2000 average.  As I understand it, this is the only period for which a realistic comparison is possible due to satellite data first being available in 1979. newlinechar  newlinechar http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images/daily_images/N_timeseries.png newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In addition, there are sometimes claims that the evidence is in when the Northwest Passage opens up, when it has been documented at the turn of the 20th century that this route was open for passage to explorers of the day.

Good point, we need to do away with all gray areas. Well, we could do like te_anau suggested in a comment below and get a percentage of all unemployed people of working age from all who are of working age who could be working. After all, there's absolutely no gray areas there, so it should be closest to this 'real' unemployment rate you speak of, right? newlinechar  newlinechar Here's the thing. [Somebody calculated just that, and came up with 35%.](http://www.sandersresearch.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1403&amp;Itemid=97#ftnt01) I don't know if it's entirely accurate since it looks like they did some math with the BLS disability statistics to get that figure, but it's interesting nonetheless, don't you think?  newlinechar  newlinechar And I wasn't just speaking about discouraged workers, but rather all marginally attached workers. Seems like by the time you've been unemployed for the length of time that it takes you to run out of unemployment, you just sort of wind up on the marginally attached list. Some have said you ARE added on that list when you've been unemployed for a certain length of time, I've read that by people who've made posts at the motley fool, but it's hard to say for sure without looking at the methodology for the survey they're using to make the stats, isn't it? newlinechar  newlinechar As far as differentiating between who's discouraged and who doesn't want a job, I can't think of anybody in this economic climate who wouldn't want a job. Should there really be a difference there? I'm not so sure. Most people I know are living paycheck to paycheck at this point, and if they lost their job, they simply wouldn't be able to afford to not want a job. It would be either get a job, or be homeless.

In this case, because the puck was gone long enough for Brown to let up, the hit could be considered interference. newlinechar  newlinechar In the second case, the NHL has been trying to cut down on blows to the head and the resulting concussions that stem from them. In this case, contact was made to Hudler's head, but it doesn't really look like Brown lifted his shoulder or elbows to do it intentionally; Hudler just had his head down. newlinechar  newlinechar Brown could get a game or 2 for the late hit.

We have 6 different tax brackets; how many do you have?

&gt; To this end, the government bumped the earliest French-immersion entry point to Grade 3 from Grade 1 and swapped core French -- essentially one session of French per school day, which research shows to be largely ineffective in creating bilingual graduates -- in favour of a more intensive approach beginning in Grade 5. newlinechar  newlinechar This part really surprised me. I went to French immersion in Winnipeg, and all of the programs I have heard of here begin in kindergarten. That was part of the point of the system - to immerse kids in the language at an early age to facilitate bilingual learning. It seems to me that this would also at least partially negate the 'streaming' effect noted in the article.

Its true about the cost ratio. I am a cook at a chain restaurant, but its owned by a large franchise that owns 15 different restaurants. And we are the flagship restaurant in Canada for this chain. So everyone are cooks and only the sous chef and the chef have their Red Seals (Chef certificate) My friends dad has it, and he works in one of the best catering + restaurants in the City. And you need to be at least on your level 3 (meaning you have to have done more than just be enrolled in culinary school)   newlinechar  newlinechar This makes this chain a unique one. Its sub owned by a company that prides in its quality, so everything is top notch. We pull in between 40-100K a week (we are a provincial capital in the mid-west of Canada)  newlinechar  newlinechar The only thing I have learned about this industry, is that I hate having them (the chain) beating down my back to do ALL my work and be out in 6 hrs. Ugh and the cuts, sores on feet, sketchy waitresses, being a dish bitch. Also I hate how many kids don`t have knife skills and don`t know basic words such as Julienned, Butterflied, Bakers, Mashers, Expo.  newlinechar  newlinechar I also hate how most people I work with are alcoholics, somewhat dysfunctional (I can be at times due to heavy stress), and are heavy drug users.   newlinechar  newlinechar Also since I`m just a cook, I get paid dick. My old boss is now making $35 an hour + tips in a city where a nice apartment can be bought for 300-500 dollars. newlinechar  newlinechar **tl;dr - Franchise restaurants are decent depending on the companies outlook, but the people you work with are often sketchy. The pay is poor as well at times.**  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I fucking hate working for the Ramsey copy cat cunts.
Okay, here is what these so called 'Christians' are so mad at, comments she made on twitter: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar • 'Everyone deserves to love and be loved and most importantly smile.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar • 'Jesus loves you and your partner and wants you to know how much he cares!

And countless other passages. It boggles the mind how deluded these people are from understanding what true Christianity is.

I think Don Cherry makes about 1 good point every coaches corner. The rest of what he says is usually stupid/offensive/wildly entertaining but I think if you write him off as an old idiot you'll miss out on his one good point. newlinechar  newlinechar He was going on about how the reason the Flames couldn't beat the Hawks is because they played Kiprusoff too much throughout the season. newlinechar  newlinechar I was looking at the teams still in it and not one of them has a starting goaltender that played 70 games. Ward played 68, Fleury played 62 and then there's a huge drop off. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand there were a few teams eliminated in the 1st round who didn't get what they were hoping for from their goaltenders who played quite a bit: Kiprusoff 76 games, Mason 57 games (but he played almost all of them for the last 3 months or so), Nabokov 62 games (but if you look at his game log he played a TON of games between Jan-April and he was less than stellar in the playoffs), Lundqvist 70 games, Brodeur 30 games (but he played almost every one after coming back from injury in late February). newlinechar  newlinechar It's certainly a decent explanation for some of the round one outcomes and, while Cherry might not be able to pronounce Kiprusoff, the numbers do back up his point. newlinechar 
Mandating a certain type of system to determine an athletic champion is not even comparable to regulating the financial industry or safety standards on vehicles. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have a problem with the President outlawing the Flying V or if Congress stepped in to protect student-athletes, but that isn't what is happening.

If your logic were right that would only be a megabyte and you need 16 megabytes for the headers anyway, but... newlinechar  newlinechar This only reduces the size of strings that are exactly 15 bytes long.  Strings less than 15 bytes were handled by the old short string optimization and only use the 16 byte header object.  Strings greater than 15 require some heap allocation, which probably has a minimum size and some overhead.  Strings that are exactly 15 bytes would save you the overhead for heap allocation plus the minimum size of a heap allocation, which probably works out to several bytes.  So, if you have a million 15 byte strings this would probably save you a few megabytes, but if you have a million 14 byte or 16 byte strings this won't save you anything. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  Corrected header size (it is 16, not 12) and string lengths (15, not 16)

The speaker is always irrelevant unless you believe that the status of the speaker can change reality through their statements.  Toa rgue that their argument HAS to be wrong because of the speaker requires you to believe that if that speaker presented a point like 'the sky is blue', reality would have to reconfigure itself to make that be false.  The truth is that anyone can make true statements, regardless of their motivations, background, etc and the only way to tell if their statements are true or not is to evaluate them directly.

&gt;Building nuclear plants is cost-prohibitive, he said, adding that the last price he saw was more than $7,000 a kilowatt -- more expensive than solar energy. 'Until costs get to some reasonable cost, I don't think anybody's going to [talk] that seriously,' he said. 'Coal plants are sort of in the same boat, they're not quite as expensive.' newlinechar  newlinechar If you momentarily grant the $7,000/kW figure (for purpose of discussion), and a comparable figure for solar power, this FERC chair's logic is completely wrong and frighteningly ignorant for the office he holds. See: newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor#Typical_capacity_factors newlinechar  newlinechar Say the **same** watt generating capacity were to cost the **same** amount for solar and nuclear. Well then, the nuclear watt generates 5x-8x more energy per day, on average, than the **same** watt of solar power. (90% capacity factor vs. 12-20%). So if the same cost gets you 5x-8x more product, it's hardly the same thing is it? Solar power in this scenario is 5x-8x more expensive, not 'the same' price, even if the capital cost/watt is the same. newlinechar  newlinechar My earlier comment (includes a real-world figure from this year, of $7.60/W for a solar installation): newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/8hc1b/san_jose_homeowner_spends_more_than_100000_to_go/c09a33l newlinechar  newlinechar Not that it really matters here, but I dispute  the $7,000/kW figure, as in this comment: newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/8gudw/why_not_to_bet_on_nuclear/c098sm1 newlinechar  newlinechar I claim it is a statistical outlier, being 2x-3x higher than most other cost figures worldwide.

Most of that is personal training and acceptance. Generally though, not enough of the public goes to restaurants with those requirements (or at least they don't openly voice it), so most establishments don't make big concessions for them. Every kitchen I've been in has always had 'safe' dishes that we can recommended to vegetarians or people with celiacs or whatnot, but it's definitely not a requirement and there's not too many governing boards that give you that type of education; it's more of a 'above and beyond' type of situation.

Really? Because what he's doing strikes me as pathetic. Perhaps he isn't breaking any law - but if so, I'd sure like to see that loophole closed.

No, but I know where you can find the real deal for free.
I'm not so sure about that. I've seen some very impressive hunting by cats.  newlinechar  newlinechar I had a very gross disgusting fat mangy slob of a cat when I was a kid. Once we were in the yard. She was laying on the ground (her favorite pastime) and some birds were close by. The cat was so fat and lazy, I think the birds assumed she was harmless and got gradually closer and closer. Finally the cat just reached up and picked one of the birds out of the air. That was the end of the bird. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm pretty sure cats do need to be taught to hunt by another cat (or maybe just the finer points of the technique). I've had cats that never hunted until another cat showed them how. newlinechar  newlinechar The one that was taught was a bitchy little Siamese calico and in her waning years she ended up killing two or three rats that were all bigger than her at the same time.

[moved my comment to a reply to yours, it fits better here] newlinechar  newlinechar People put a ton of work into open source projects, they're often used by big corporations.  It's difficult to monetize them.  Consulting companies make a lot of money off of selling support for them (think IBM, Redhat, etc).  Not all programmers are willing to work for no money, but others are... and do sometimes. newlinechar  newlinechar I think a lot of parallels can be drawn.  So why is there a militant response amongst artists to other artists doing work for free, but the response amongst programmers seems to be pretty positive? newlinechar  newlinechar I think it hinges around customizations and improvements being requested/made to open source projects.  Companies often give back to better the work, etc.   newlinechar  newlinechar Could the artist community organize some mechanism to encourage collaboration and sharing without sacrificing their time for nothing?  Often an open source project will be picked up by a company or a company will help fund the project. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe a site could be formed to share art, where companies would be encouraged to add the art they've paid for to the pool of art, as well as to share new art being created specifically for them.  i.e. I need a paintbrush icon, I pay an artist to create it, and share it with the project. newlinechar  newlinechar Then again, maybe the parallel doesn't exist because the artist community wants to be more quid pro quo. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the other thing that might not fit is that artists seem to expect to be paid per use of their art, rather than for creating of their art.  Consulting companies and software development companies sometimes use this model, but individual programmers almost always are paid salary and the company retains all copyrights to the work created. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the two industries have a lot in common, but they have taken two entirely different paths.  I think each could learn a lot from the other.

I'm much more against bad spelling and the military than I am against libraries, actually.  newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, libraries and (good) public schools are necessary for any kind of representative government.  The populace must have the resources to be informed. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the military is a crappy example.  In an era of MAD, a standing army, particularly one on a scale that we have, is totally unnecessary for defensive war.  All we really need is a skeleton crew for disaster relief, and for keeping fingers in the general vicinity of buttons.  You know why?  Because if we were ever to be actually threatened by another major government, there would be no rolling out of troops, and no deployment of tanks.  There would be a lot of very bright lights and hard radiation, and the bulk of the war would be over inside an hour.   newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, I respect the people who are willing to put their lives on the line in service for our country.  But their service is no longer being used or necessary for the defense of the populace.

Our average incomes aren't that much less than the US..

George Packer had an interesting article in the New Yorker a few months ago about the state budget of Florida being irrationally dependent upon the housing bubble.

For one, continuation passing just seems to optimize better than building and taking apart tuples, like the usual State implementation does. But I suppose that doesn't figure into the headline, since it's comparing to other CPS state monads. newlinechar  newlinechar For two, a default continuation passing State with an Int state looks like: newlinechar  newlinechar     State Int a ~ forall r. (a -&gt; Int -&gt; r) -&gt; Int -&gt; r newlinechar  newlinechar The adaptive state uses some fancy new type stuff to turn this into: newlinechar  newlinechar     State Int a ~ forall r. (a -&gt; Int# -&gt; r) -&gt; Int# -&gt; r newlinechar  newlinechar where `Int#` is an unboxed integer. A normal `Int` is implemented like a pointer to some code that calculates an `Int#`, which is necessary for it to be able to be undefined. If that doesn't make sense, don't worry about it. Suffice it to say that this removes some indirection, and gets things optimized about as much as is possible (it's unlikely that GHC's optimizer could do this manually, because in order for unboxing to be semantics preserving, it has to be sure that the `Int` you put in the state will eventually be evaluated; it's unlikely to be able to be sure of that in general).
&gt; Perhaps Hitchens wants to reach for religion or supernaturalism as an everlasting, poor alternative to naturalism that would keep naturalism a vital, living truth rather than a dead dogma. newlinechar  newlinechar I've listened to this video thrice, and I have to say that I think this is exactly what Hitchens was saying.

No people given more power should have more consequences for breaking the law. Cops should lose their job for breaking any law above a misdemeanor. They should also face at least the maximum penalty for any law they do break. The same should go for judges, senators congressmen and presidents. 
A friend of mine is a civil engineer with the Port Authority of NY &amp; NJ (the owners of the buildings).  He said when the announcement was made over the public address system for everyone to remain in their offices, all of the engineers ran out of the building because they knew better, that the building wouldn't stay standing for too long. newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately, most people didn't have the luxury of an engineering degree.
That's a silly way to look at it. Most (Read: MOST, I know there are some less fortunate) people just finishing school still have a place to live at their parents and don't have all the bills to pay for that others would so I don't think they are that bad off.  newlinechar  newlinechar With that in mind, it's not as bad as some family of 2 kids who are down on their mortgage and haven't had work for 6 months. That's what I meant.

It may sound whiny. But it is the truth. Read the comments on this page. People are straight-up attacking people for sharing a different viewpoint.

I don't think it will eventually be one of those companies that seriously addresses the issue, it will be the government, trying to get back some of the tax revenue they have lost to piracy. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that savvy people will never be stopped.

Napster was a household name, everybody was using it, heck, I think it's the single biggest reason we now all have flat rate broadband, downloading music was the killer app.. newlinechar  newlinechar And it sent a pretty big message when it was shutdown...  That's probably the same rationale behind focusing so much on Pirate Bay.  Popularity is the #1 liability in the piracy game.

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that the entire reason we went with a 401k? Because employers didn't want the expense of pensions and employees wanted better returns?

From what I read, the stuff wasn't completely converted.  They had just loaded up the stuff in a truck.  So there is an issue of whether or not she was actually deprived of possession of the hoop.  This might be the sticky point. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, being a law student, I looked up Texas's theft statute which is Sec. 31.03 - and if the above issue isnt the problem, then it should be a clear cut case of simple theft (in fact sec. 31.02 says all the 'thefts' were consolidated into sec. 31.03 which would indicate that the statute should be read very broadly so as to incorporate all common law defined thefts):  newlinechar  newlinechar 'THEFT. (a) person commits an offense if he unlawfully appropriates property with intent to deprive the owner of property.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'Appropriate' is defined in Sec. 31 as 'to bring about a transfer or 'purported' transfer of title to or other nonpossessory interest in property, whether to the actor or another....' newlinechar  newlinechar This seems like a very broad definition of 'appropriate.'  First, it need only be purported - which appears to be intended to cover things like a misrepresentation type of theft (con artist?).  Second, the stuff doesn't need to be transferred to the actor... theft can be done by transferring to a third party, like the guys picking up the basketball hoops.  So it looks like, as long as the guys loading up the hoop into a truck is sufficient for 'other nonpossessory interest' then we have simple theft.  newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, I think the DA might just be trying to get out of having to prosecute the cop with some type of 'nutting fits the bill sir!' BS.  Prosecuting a cop doesn't make a DA popular with the department, I am sure. newlinechar  newlinechar One odd quirk in the language of sec. 31 is the following: newlinechar  newlinechar '(d) It is not a defense to prosecution under this section newlinechar that: (1) the offense occurred as a result of a deception or strategy on the part of a law enforcement agency, including the use of an undercover operative or peace officer....' newlinechar  newlinechar The legislature probably intended the cops to be the good guys and prevent crooks from saying 'Hey, the undercover cop asked me to steal something for him.'  But here we have a cop that deceived craigslist readers into converting the basketball hoop.  The interesting result could be that the guys that took the hoops could also be charged - after all, it was the result of deception on the part of the cop - and they could not even introduce evidence of the fact that a cop posted a craigslist ad.  So all you 'textualist' out there... please stop being so rigid and consider legislative intent. :)

Ah, Alan Watts. He was an extremely intelligent guy, but he lacked a certain sense of realism. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically he expected everybody else to be able to think on the same level as him. And didn't understand that for those who aren't... different teachings work better. Hell, it's simpler than that: only different teachings, or pure savagery, no other choice for the 99%. newlinechar  newlinechar He just didn't understand the realistic need for some sort of elitism. That for the top 1%, Buddhism, Greek philosophy, or any other free and unbounded search for truth is a great thing, but for the other 99% you simply should not try the same: you should just feed them some dogma that keeps them fairly moral, otherwise, they will quickly revert to barbarians and society falls apart. You can actually witness this barbarism already happening in West Midlands, UK.  newlinechar  newlinechar He was intelligent, but he wasn't really wise in this sense. He wasn't _realistic_. He committed the classical intellectual mistake thinking everybody is just as smart as him, or can be.  newlinechar  newlinechar His teachings are excellent for the 1% and he deserves much praise for it.  newlinechar  newlinechar But OTOH he contributed a lot to the slow sinking into barbarism of the 99%, because he challenged the dogmas that kept the 99% docile and fairly civilized. He and thousands of others, challenged those, just because they are not true. So what? They are not true, indeed, but they DID help to keep the masses somewhat civilized. Now that those dogmas are destroyed, and the masses will never be Buddhist nor any other kind of free-enquiry mindset, you can witness the darkness, the barbarism slowly spreading.

 newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; here is already a europe-wide socialist system.

In a socialised world, it is as if your decisions doesn't really matter. There are no people truly succeeding or failing.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In many countries, you have to work extremely hard to succeed – and competition to get ahead is immense. Maybe that is also a reason why the USA's university system is so much better – because people truly compete (if you compare economy size, Germany and France's university system is not that good when compared to the USA). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; 'a lot of european guys go to other countries to live and work' This is because we like to see the world and experience other cultures. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe. I just don't know why there are so many people from Europe you can shake a stick at. A lot of those people permanently life in other countries. Maybe it is just the weather. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, these are just some thoughts open to debate. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Just another thought. People act as if income inequality is the problem. I don't think it is - poverty is the true problem. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar People can be rich while there are still a high income inequality (for example, half the population earns $100,000, the other half earns $1,000,000). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In a globalised world, people's salary will tend to be near each other globally.

Dude...!
Here's a rundown. Although I do not qualify as a computer security expert -- not by any means -- I do try to carefully follow those that are experts, and part of the consulting that I do is in computer security, including government-contracted research. newlinechar  newlinechar A simple one-way hash is a good start, but you can also 'salt' the hash. Salting refers to adding a known component to a password before passing it through the hash function. So, for example: newlinechar  newlinechar hash('salt'+userpass) newlinechar  newlinechar A system-wide salt doesn't do anything useful for added security, though. An attacker will simply discover the salt and still be able to compromise passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar So what you do instead is you change the salt for each password. The new challenge is in storing the salts and keeping track of everything, but the cool thing about a one-way hash is, even if you know part of the password, it doesn't help you discover the rest of the password. newlinechar  newlinechar In your database then, you'd have rows where the passwords might look like, newlinechar  newlinechar unique_salt:hash newlinechar  newlinechar Now if an attacker wants to compromise passwords, they have to calculate all of the hashes for each password individually. They can't simply generate a list of all of the hash values that your function would generate. This slows them down considerably. newlinechar  newlinechar But wait, there's more! To slow them down even further, you can use a very slow hash function which takes the salt and the password, hashes that, then hashes the hash, then hashes the hash ... and so on and so forth. Thousands of times even. newlinechar  newlinechar See, the thing is, your server doesn't spend that much time on users logging in or out. It spends most of its time on other things -- so you don't need a speed-optimized hash function. If your hash function is slow instead, then an attacker has to spend all this extra time generating hash values to attack even a single user's password. newlinechar  newlinechar See also http://www.matasano.com/log/958/enough-with-the-rainbow-tables-what-you-need-to-know-about-secure-password-schemes/

It's not all that radical of a notion to argue that women prefer security over freedom. newlinechar  newlinechar Blaming women's suffrage, however, ignores what happened in 1913: the income tax, the (unfortunate) rebirth of central banking, and the direct election of senators.  Those three things had much more to do with expansive government than women voting.  Though I'd suggest that woman's suffrage contributed.

&gt;A system-wide salt doesn't do anything useful for added security newlinechar  newlinechar I beg to differ.  Even if I only use a global salt I have just nullified any plain vanilla rainbow table you might have - you would have to build a new rainbow table from scratch.  Also, often the global salt is stored on a different server than the database itself, so even if the database is compromised, figuring out the salt so you can build a new rainbow table isn't going to be feasible. newlinechar  newlinechar Per key salts are obviously better though, since you would need to construct a rainbow table for each password you are trying to crack. newlinechar  newlinechar I personally use both a global and a per key salt in my hashing mechanism.
This is really bothering me since it's been happening more and more lately. When I go to view the next 25 submission on Reddit, often I get the message, 'there doesn't seem to be anything here.'

 newlinechar I have offices in both Albany and Buffalo and I have coworkers in both places... nobody knows anything about any camps. newlinechar  newlinechar The map that someone released recently put both camps right in the middle of downtown in both cities, and there are absolutely, definitely, no camps there. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you have any addresses or Google tags for any of these camps?  Longitude and latitude?  Are things so far gone that an American citizen can't drive up and take pictures of these camps? newlinechar  newlinechar How about *groups* of American citizens?  I don't understand how these camps are so well known and common and nobody has taken pictures of them and posted the details for all to see.  How is it possible for solid, upstanding Americans can know so much about these camps but can't demonstrate their existence? newlinechar  newlinechar You can understand my confusion.

I don't think that it would ever prevent me from working in my chosen field (I wont be working with kids or anything) I just don't want that to be attached to my reputation

I already stated this in another thread. newlinechar  newlinechar Our policies during the regan years are *part* of the reason for the attacks. newlinechar  newlinechar We didn't plant Radical Islam, it already was there.  Regan funded and trained them to fight the russians.  It was a terrible idea.  And we still prop up despots, dictators, and other nasty regimes and I still disagree about it. newlinechar  newlinechar The attacks would not have happened without Radical Islam. newlinechar  newlinechar If you mean The Man being Bin Laden, then yes, he was trained by the US.  We didn't train  him to fly jet planes, nor to fly them into US skyscrapers.  The people who actually carried out the attack were trained here, by duped instructors. newlinechar  newlinechar These attacks are only one reason why Radical Islam has to go.  There are many other more important reasons.  Oppression of women, brutal and unjust Sharia law, hateful acts, suicide bombing, etc.

From what I see, it is not a standard practice. It is a best practice, but many developers just won't bother (or don't know how) to do it. newlinechar  newlinechar I even saw a web application that displayed the password on the user pages, pages that can be seen with some fairly low privileges. The password was white on white.  newlinechar  newlinechar It is clear that for many teams, password security is not a very big concern.

Well, we already have things like the [Stony Brook Algorithm Repository](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/) and various newsgroups.

Argh- Busy season at work was a real beating, which led to stress induced sleeping problems. This issue was solved when I was laid off, giving me a few weeks to find a job, or I get deported (have 2 more weeks left!). Following this, I got my first ever cavity. Then my car (my beautiful baby) broke down and needed expensive repairs. On top of all of this, it looks like my favourite football (soccer) team sucks so bad that they will be dropped to a lower league.  newlinechar  newlinechar Sigh. When it rains, it pours.

I see quite a few problems with your suggestion: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. My house is not long enough, so I'd have to spray paint it vertically, which is dangerous and I don't have the necessary equipment. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Maybe I better spray paint INSIDE the house, thus I won't need to remember it, thus freeing a few bits of brain bites. newlinechar  newlinechar 3. (If you got here, you are quite serious...) I would argue that transmitting it as plain text is **not** as well as spray painting it on the house, because spray painting doesn't preserve meta data such as mail address and mail content without which you have no use for a password.
I made a lot of progress on my last attempt but ended up getting my ass kicked somewhere near state monads and existential types. newlinechar  newlinechar The syntax is easy, that's not the problem at all.  I think I had it mastered in two weeks.   newlinechar  newlinechar The problem is that I've been studying Haskell off and on for at least two years and I still really have no idea how to write a useful program.  I've never failed so hard at something I put so much effort into learning before, but for me at least, that's half the appeal of Haskell. newlinechar

On one level, I mean that self aware beings have the capacity to guide their own development. From selective breeding to genetic engineering, people have the tools to decide how future generations will be (not to mention individuals having the freedom of choosing not to breed at all or even to kill themselves). On another level, I mean that intelligence is a whole level of complexity beyond mere life--just as life is a level of complexity beyond mere matter. I think these ideas about complexity levels come from a scientist called Ilya Prigogine, though my first exposure to them was in the sci-fi book *Schismatrix*.

&gt; What women don't seem to understand ... is that there is a difference between 'equal' and 'same'. newlinechar  newlinechar This situation is not one of (mis)understanding. newlinechar  newlinechar One of the fundamental tenets of feminist *theory* is that gender is a consequence of society and culture, not biology.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately for them (and all of us) the feminist theory that males and females are psychologically identical at birth is **wrong**. This has been proven by science and by feminists themselves who were disappointed as parents by their inability to gender-bend their own children.  newlinechar  newlinechar There is a *component* of gender which is due to society and culture, but that difference is built upon a fundamental difference built into our biology and psychology, honed by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.
I understand your logic about the two genealogies. newlinechar  newlinechar I do not, however, understand the second point. newlinechar  newlinechar Are you saying that, in addition to writing about a timeline, that the Bible must declare that everything is true in relation to everything else to be true? newlinechar  newlinechar If I say that I worked 5 hours this morning, then 6 hours this afternoon... do I really need to declare that I worked 11 hours today for it to be true? newlinechar  newlinechar The Bible discusses the beginning of Earth in Genesis 1.  You can keep track of the time through either genealogical stream and come up with a total of something between 6,000 and 13,000 years. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't want to be snide... but if I'm missing the point of your 2nd sentence, help a brother out.  It seems to be as simple as A + B = C, B + C = D, therefore D = 2C - A.

This is also calumny. newlinechar  newlinechar Questioning religious dogma is perfectly fine. newlinechar  newlinechar Questioning evolutionary dogma.... well, that is the atheistic equivalent of breaking all 10 commandments as once. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I am Catholic.  I was Protestant.  I know of very, very few devout families who don't encourage questions about their beliefs from their kids. newlinechar  newlinechar If you expect them to listlessly sit by while you dismantle belief in God, thereby condemning their kids to an eternity in hell... well then, I think I see the issue there. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and authority doesn't become 'arbitrary' just because you personally don't like it.  Otherwise, I would disavow an Obama presidency as would most devout Christians. newlinechar  newlinechar Regretfully, whether you like the Bible and whether I like Obama is irrelevant to the respective authority each carries.

This anti-cop sentiment is a bit of reverse-entrapment if you ask me. I know a few cops and they are good guys but, like anyone, if they roll up one someone who is being a fucking asshole to them, they're going to get hostile. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sorry if you truly believe that most cops are 'school bullies' but maybe you should wonder if they're not just bullies to you because you're such a fucking prick to them in the first place.  newlinechar  newlinechar A vast majority of them are just trying to help out, get paid, and raise a family.

Even if the idea didn't originate with Walsh, he *is* the one who went through all these strips and 'revised' them. newlinechar  newlinechar To say that Jim Davis deserves the exclusive credit makes a lot less sense. Yes, Walsh's strips use Davis's work, but Davis's strips are entirely different, with different context and different meaning. The *Minus* strips radically alter Davis's vision, and as such, it would be difficult to consider them his work.
Really?  Well, now I have to read the whole thing. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Those who choose to wear their pants this way cite comfort as their motive. newlinechar  newlinechar I have to call bullshit on that one.

There's no way that's comfortable.  Those men are slaves to fashion.
That's actually a great link. Thanks. And here's sort of what I'm arguing about (fta): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Here’s a “state of the art” scheme from a recent blog post on rainbow tables and salts: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; hash = md5('deliciously-salty-' + password) newlinechar  newlinechar It's unfortunate, but I believe this thing is a standard in many systems. newlinechar  newlinechar And it blows my mind that people think a one-way hash is automatically secure. A slow hashing function would make passwords more secure in this arbitrary and hypothetical example of a database and application being compromised.

I agree with everything you wrote, however I still think it's more complicated. newlinechar  newlinechar They consented to join the military, which means they consented to being brainwashed and turned into something of an emotionless killing robot.  Nobody was holding a gun to their head when they enlisted. newlinechar  newlinechar I think it gets more complicated still, though, because of social/economic forces which shape that initial decision to enlist.  The current US version of capitalism has put many in a position where enlisting is a very tempting offer.  Social forces from the media to 'patriotic' school textbooks to pledging the flag every day in school all shape a culture where signing up to be brainwashed into an immoral killing machine is celebrated and praised by friends and family. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the education system in the US is partially to blame as well.  These 18 year olds don't know the US' recent imperialistic tendencies and the media doesn't fill in that gap either.  These kids don't know exactly how immoral the history of the US military is, all the way down to the grunts. newlinechar  newlinechar edit: I think the damage to these kids is already done.  I think the solution from here is to speak up honestly about the realities of enlistment, of the US military and about US history.  Enlistment is a very big moral decision and if these kids aren't told the truth by someone, this will continue to happen. newlinechar  newlinechar I recently talked a very smart, left-leaning, college graduate out of enlisting who was totally ready to sign because  of the bad job market.

Are you kidding me? Atheism is not a religious belief. As such it is automatically secular. newlinechar  newlinechar The foundations of atheism is the rejection of religion based upon overwhelming natural evidence that contradicts supernatural explanation. There is nothing religious about it. Presenting facts that support the claim that religion is nonsense and intellectually crippling should be part of the responsibility of a good school. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't care what the laws say. At the end of the day there should be zero-tolerance for religion in the public schools. Atheism is most certainly not in the same league as religion.

Probably because any decent RPGer is going to a) have at least one die capable of factoring to d5, b) have the mental ability to be able to factor it to d5, unlike the average simpleton - who generally don't RPG. newlinechar  newlinechar That is, if you have a d10 or a d20, you can infere a d5 roll from them it's just a simple case of (x/2)+1 or (x/4)+1. If you're RPGing and you can't do those calculations in your head, you're doing something wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar Likewise, the d4 was often considered pointless among the people I RPGed with, a d20 with (x/5)+1 works just as well, and doesn't involve carrying around stupidly non-rollable, pointy ended things. The people that had a d4 in their collection tended to be the poseurs with crystal dice that didn't actually RPG at all, and if they did, didn't RP. They kept their dice in a nice velvet pouch though, and could tell you just how much they paid for each one.

THC is fat soluble, meaning it dissolves into solution in fats or oils. newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, one interesting thing to note: before marijuana is dried, the THC is bound to a water molecule that effectively neutralizes it's potency. This is why weed really has to be dried and cured to be usable, once the bond between THC and H2o is broken the THC then becomes available for use.

Fair comment, but this leaves a question I've never been able to answer: if you're code reviewing something from a very junior developer, and it's really not very good, how do you handle the situation constructively? Obviously it would be better not to give someone a project that is too big or too complicated for them to handle, but that's not always your choice. If they have been given one, and now there are dozens of things you'd change for reasonably objective reasons, how do you help them to learn and improve while also safeguarding your project's code base from getting substandard material added because by the time you'd fixed all the major flaws, no-one had any heart left to go after all the minor details?

Why do people continuously view the artistic pleasures in life as a job? Have you ever played an instrument for an extended period in your life? It is wonderful to be able to pick up an object and have it somehow make the beautiful sounds that it does. The only thing money has done to the music industry is corrupt. You ever wonder why their are so many shitty bands? It's because people started to try and make a living off the music played instead of really loving the music being created. It's all about manipulation, and how to make the most money (what's the best way to look/the best sound to have) instead of using the creative mind to produce something unique to one's own person... not for greed or popularity.  newlinechar  newlinechar So...

&gt;Each participant's response to the caffeine or placebo was measured using three different measures — brain electrical activity via electroencephalogram (EEG); blood flow velocity in the brain via ultrasound; and participants' self-reports of subjective effects via questionnaires. newlinechar  newlinechar Where's the fMRI?

&gt;It is still a fairly large difference. Here are the GDP (PPP) for the 4 large economies in Europe (...) $10,000-$15,000 dollars is quite a bit (IMHO). newlinechar  newlinechar It is indeed! But in real life, the [difference in productivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita_per_hour) isn't very big. Here are the GDP(PPP)/hour of the same countries you listed: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;2 	United States 35.90 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;4 	France 35.09 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;9 	United Kingdom 31.27 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;14 	Germany 29.69 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;15 	Italy 29.22 newlinechar  newlinechar As you can see here, a French worker and an American worker contribute about **the same** to GDP per hour. The French just prefer to go on vacation while the Americans prefer to work extra. You cannot say that the American system produces better workers, it just indoctrinates people into working more hours. The French have the same opportunity to obtain monetary wealth as the Americans, but people _choose_ to work less; in effect, **'buying'** time off (+ the French actually have the choice because of their labour laws). In my opinion, it's all in how you measure these things. newlinechar  newlinechar Which leads me to my next point: GDP is not the end all measure of prosperity; it's an _indicator_ of prosperity. The USA is highly commercialised compared to many European countries, so more purchases take place, inflating the GDP. For example: Italian stay-home mamas doing housework don't earn a salary, yet they produce services. American nannies doing the same work would be paid for it, though, thus visibly contributing to the economy. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you couple this with the [income inequality of European countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality), you can actually construct an argument of sorts implying that most Europeans are generally materially and opportunity-wise _better_ off than their counterparts across the Atlantic. newlinechar  newlinechar **Food for thought!** Anyway, I liked your post and I'm not necessarily completely disagreeing with you :-)
I don’t know that much about court decisions, but it looks like the text of this ruling was written by one of the other judges. Is it fair to assume it reflects Sotomayor’s thinking?
I used to get the cold 2-3 times a year. Then I discovered alternative medicine. I have not been sick in more years than I care to put down in writing. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't wait to get sick. Once the cold/flu season is a-comin' I take precautions. Pharma has agreed that organic vit.C (lemon) and stuff in honey which eludes my ability to remember words with more than 7 syllables, is superior to anything synthetic. Also, honey's  antiseptic and antibacterial properties were chemically explained only recently. newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore PREventive is not synonymous with battling a full-blown illness. newlinechar  newlinechar I am NOT advocating lemons and honey for pneumonia or any advanced illness. There is room for all forms of medicine. Just as a doctor is careful in measuring a dosage for a child, or someone in advanced stages. newlinechar  newlinechar If alternative medicine were BS, American pharma companies would not be out in full force patenting contents of trees and plants (yup!) in places like India, whose plants' contents have been used to good effect for millennia. newlinechar  newlinechar Neither synthetic nor organic assure a cure. Let's be honest about it. Each has its own time and efficacy. newlinechar  newlinechar Thus your silly sarcasm is lost on me.

Ah, that reminds me of my biggest gripe. I didn't see the thread until it already had a gazillion replies. I like to start with the first reply, and read the thread as it progresses. Well, on reddit, if you want to start at the beginning, you have to scroll to the bottom of the thread. But reddit abbreviates the thread, leaving a very slow link at the bottom to 'load more replies.' So, I did, and it gave me some more, but still abbreviated it with the slow-responding 'load more replies' link at the bottom. After a half-dozen or so repetitions, FireFox stopped responding, so that was that. newlinechar  newlinechar So: I don't like that there is no option to list replies in chronological order, as opposed to the default reverse-chronological order. I almost always scroll to the bottom and read my way back up, which gets tedious because you have to track up to the next original reply, then read the replies to that, then track up past that to the next original replay, then read the replies to that....

'Blade Runner' nearly requires a love of film noir and mental gymnastics regarding the metaphysics of being human.

The exact opposite argument is used to justify outlawing euthanasia: if it were allowed, people may feel forced to commit euthanasia to themselves, because they feel like a burden.

Idiotic. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; However, he said he will have an out-of-pocket cost of 'at least'' $100,000 after he receives a federal tax credit of about $45,000 and a state rebate of almost $30,000. newlinechar  newlinechar So this one guy gets $75,000 from taxpayers for this farce. Fuck! newlinechar  newlinechar For future reference (I keep track of these things): this is $175,000 for 23 kWe capacity, or $7.60/W. If you factor in capacity factor, it's something like 15%, or 3.5 kWe average, or $50.72/W average; in other words, $50.72 for the equivalent of a baseload watt. newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor#Typical_capacity_factors newlinechar  newlinechar Reminds me: the FERC dumbass said nuclear power is more expensive than solar now, using a nuclear highball figure of $7/W. If we temporarily grant this number, and the $7/W solar number, you immediately see what nonsense this is: the nuclear plant runs at 90% capacity factor, and the solar plant at 15%, so if the cost per watt were the same, the nuclear option gives you six times more energy for that watt. Which by any sane standards means it's the cheaper option, and by a huge factor. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/04/22/22greenwire-no-need-to-build-new-us-coal-or-nuclear-plants-10630.html newlinechar  newlinechar I fear, the FERC chairman, supposedly an expert on electricity matters, may be so completely incompetent that he doesn't even know what a capacity factor is.

Dearest Nathan Filyk, newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think that I know everything, but I do think that much of what the troofers say is an outright falsehood. I do not think of myself as some anti-troofer crusader 'serving America'. I simply come here for entertainment.  newlinechar  newlinechar My 'how to increase your carbon footprint' submission was right around Earth Day. I really did increase my carbon footprint that day because I left the heat on and increased my food miles. I also plugged in a refrigerator that I had unplugged for the whole winter and left the lights on all day. So what? Do you have a problem with people who simply want to leave their mark on the world now? It's not like I was littering or dumping pollutants into the ecosystem on Earth Day, I was just consuming more energy that day. My extra power consumption actually was pretty inane considering that my region's powered mostly by nuclear power and my house is usually powered by the hydroelectric power plant that is located nearby.  newlinechar  newlinechar Nathan, I'm very much different than you. You keep accusing me of lying, but that is what you constantly do. You would be hard pressed to find a single lie that I've posted to the forums here on reddit.

OK, but you should still stop, think and question the notion of econometric data as 'facts'. If the data had indicated that WWII pulled the US out of depression, would it have been wise or foolish to believe it? newlinechar  newlinechar Prosperity means civilians driving cars and listening to radios. War means soldiers driving tanks and shooting bullets. War involves converting factories to war work. Factories that used to make cars and radios make tanks and shells instead. What kind of Harry Potter magic takes tanks and shells and turns them into cars and radios? newlinechar  newlinechar We are damn sure there is no such magic and not all the econometric data in the world should convince us otherwise. If, to contemplate a conterfactual, the econonometric data had 'proved' the wars rescue countries from recessions what wisdom do we distil from our knowledge? newlinechar  newlinechar If 'war ended the Great Depression' is the best we can do, that should warn us that we haven't understood. We have an explanation that doesn't work at the micro-economic level; indeed it is absurd at the micro-economic, Keynes doesn't have a magic wand that can turn tanks into cars. newlinechar  newlinechar There has to be an ingredient X that is vital and which we have missed. And if we think that starting a war is going to end a recession we are surely in for a bitter lesson on [Goodhart's Law](http://www.atm.damtp.cam.ac.uk/people/mem/papers/LHCE/goodhart.html) newlinechar  newlinechar But if we admit that the 'war ends recession' is absurd, then we can look for X, and having found it, we can end recessions directly by doing it instead. The only use for the claim that 'wars end recessions' is as a screening mechanism. Macro-economic theories have to be compatible with the properties of physical object, for example, artillery shells don't magically transform into radios. People who say 'wars end recessions' are ignoring this. You have to realise that they are mad and be sure that they do not suck you into their delusions.

&gt; The sooner that pathetic disgusting government collapses, the better. newlinechar  newlinechar I couldn't agree with you more. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I am kind of hoping Israel takes out their nuclear facilities. I'm curious what the shithead Iranians would do. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to see the Iranian regime overthrown, attacking its nuclear facilities is just about the most counterproductive thing you could do. Iranians are a proud, prickly people. They would respond to an attack by rallying behind their government, strengthening its legitimacy and giving it a new lease on life. Hardliners within the regime would be strengthened; moderates would be undermined.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, it's not entirely clear whether or not Iran currently intends to develop nuclear weapons. The Iranians claim that their nuclear program will be used only for civilian purposes (i.e. nuclear power), and we don't have conclusive proof they're lying. An attack on their nuclear facilities might set their program back a few years, but it would also make up their minds in favor of acquiring nuclear weapons. In other words, while it's possible that Iran isn't seeking to acquire nuclear weapons at the moment, it certainly would seek to acquire them in response to an attack and would mount an all-out drive to that end.
'the human soul is actually just a cluster of parasites in your brain' newlinechar  newlinechar Its closer to that, than we like to think. Modern human culture of say 100,000 years coincides with the domestication of various animals, and along with them came the parasites and our culture. domestic cats are pretty much symbiotic with humans now, they don't exist as an identifiable species outside our world. newlinechar  newlinechar I would bet a small amount that cats were domesticated long before dogs/wolves were.
The bible never gives enough information to infer the age of the earth. It does gove information relating to time passed since Adam and Eve left the garden in genesis.

There is no evidence because nobody will fund the research.  Perhaps with the cash that Jim Carrey kicked in, it may happen.  But as it stands, so many universities get so much funding from pharmaceutical companies to do other pro-pharma research, they are reluctant to perform a study that may harm the pharmaceutical companies. newlinechar  newlinechar The bottom line is we know two things: big pharma chose to use mercury vapor as a preservative for vaccines.  Though the law prevents them from doing so now in vaccines for children, they are still using Thimerosal in some cases for adult vaccines.  Typically, flu vaccines.  We also know that they have now chosen to substitute aluminum as their preservative now. newlinechar  newlinechar Based on those two things, we can infer that the pharmaceutical companies think it is acceptable to put poisonous metals into their products that will be injected into humans.  In the past century, meat processing plants thought it was OK to grind up rats and feces into their products.  And it was a bunch of 'crackpots' that protested this until the government did something.  This is an analogous situation. newlinechar  newlinechar The pharmaceutical companies are spending a lot on the PR campaign against the antivaxxers.  The antivaxxers would pretty much disappear if the poisonous metals disappeared from vaccines or if big pharma commissioned some independent studies (with no people from the pharmaceutical industry involved) that really studied the effects of vaccinating young children, from a large field of subjects, across genetic lines.  Why don't they do that?  Why do they choose to demonize people with legitimate concerns rather than grapple with the thousands of situations where vaccines are causing problems? newlinechar  newlinechar I can tell you from experience, my brother- and sister-in-law are labeled antivaxxers because of their choices to alter the schedule of vaccination for their children.  They still want the vaccines, they just want them like MMR in three doses instead of one, and free from harmful metals, and months rather than weeks in between doses.  Their son was diagnosed with hopeless autism about three weeks after receiving the MMR. He had some subdued symptoms prior to that, but the MMR seemed to cause the onset of the other symptoms.  The 'experts' said Quinn's autism was hopeless and prescribed management therapy. newlinechar  newlinechar They did not accept this outcome, and instead, Quinn is now a relatively normal child, who displays no symptoms of autism at all.  They did a lot of blood and stool samples, consulting MDs all throughout the process.  The MDs looked for any abnormalities, then they counteracted those abnormalities through diet, dietary supplements and other treatments like chelation therapy to remove the mercury from his system.  All this treatment was done under the guidance and supervision of licensed MDs. newlinechar  newlinechar The current PR campaign against people like my inlaws would have you think they care nothing about their children catching measles or smallpox.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  What they seek is a balance between the 'one size fits all' vaccination course and something that doesn't harm their children.

I mean, seriously, what does the adblock guys think websites with ads are going to do? Just shrug and and say 'I guess I give up!' without trying? In a way this kinda sounds like the adblock guys are calling 'not fair!' when it's really their job to block ads. Someone gets around it?

&gt;Let me get this straight, if it is in my best interests to kidnap you, lock you in my dungeon, tie you up and rape you, this would be a good thing? newlinechar  newlinechar That's not total individual freedom.  Mine has been lost by your actions.  I said people's *self-interests* would harmonize and fit together.  Obviously it is *not* in my self-interest to be kidnapped!  newlinechar  newlinechar Why can't you read what I said properly? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Second, there is usually a high personal cost involved in needing the services of a hospital that should more than justify the incentives to be stupid with one's body enough to cost more than one ought to cost to the healthcare system. newlinechar  newlinechar Bullshit.  You can't just claim that there are 'high personal costs' and then wash your hands with it.  You have to explain it. newlinechar  newlinechar Geez, you can't read and you can't write.  What can you do? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Third, we're talking about an overabundance of healthy people. No system is going to be perfect, but if you have to choose on which side to err, we choose to err on the side of health. newlinechar  newlinechar This statement makes no sense.  You automatically assume that socialized healthcare is the superior system, with no supporting arguments, and then on the basis of this claim, say that since socialized healthcare has on its mind the maximum health of the public, that it does in fact *result* in maximum public health. newlinechar  newlinechar Intentions does not mean results. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Fourthly, everything you said only works if everyone is perfectly rational. We aren't. newlinechar  newlinechar On the contrary, capitalism is the best system that can deal with people's irrationality.  With capitalism, a particular businessman's irrationality is subject to the choice patterns of those he serves, his customers.  If he fails at his job, then he stops managing the resources he was using in his attempt at providing people with healthcare. newlinechar  newlinechar With socialized healthcare on the other hand, the irrational actions of the government does *not* lead to the government's removal from managing whatever resources it was managing.  No, what usually ends up happening is that people like you blame the market, and ask that the government gather *more* resources, as if the government's failure is based not on its inability to economically calculate, but on a stubborn public's refusal to give more resources to the government, as if the failure of the government is because it doesn't have enough resources. newlinechar  newlinechar Then, after the government fails again, what happens?  You want the government to have more resources.  Again and again, the spiral continues. newlinechar  newlinechar Even if government officials have good *intentions*, they lack being subject to the personal profit and loss test.  They spend not their own money, but other people's money.  Waste is therefore the norm. newlinechar  newlinechar With capitalism, this would never happen.  Irrational actions will not persist, because economic losses would result, and if the errors are large enough, the person making those errors is going to find that they are no longer treating people's sickness because they go bankrupt. newlinechar  newlinechar It's amazing.  People like you claim that since people are irrational, we should institutionalize this irrationality by making it permanent for *everyone in society*.  For that is what happens when central planning exists.  At some point, irrational people will become the leaders, and since their position is a part of the government, their positions are more or less *permanent*.  If an irrational person becomes in charge, then the whole fucking country suffers.   newlinechar  newlinechar With capitalism on the other hand, if an irrational person becomes CEO, then the only people that suffer are the specific customers of his business, which is never the entire country. newlinechar  newlinechar In short, the inevitable errors that will be made are more localized in capitalism.  They are localized to the specific market the business operates in.  When the leaders of socialized healthcare screw up, the whole country suffers. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, if you were honest, and you were *serious* about dealing with people's irrationality, then you would not hold the position you do, lecturing me on healthcare.  You would want a system that can deal with it efficiently and quickly.  Capitalism is the only system that can do this.  Why?  Because in that system, we are not our brother's keepers.

Religion serves in large part to validate values one already holds. So, if you hate gays and are religious, you convince yourself that your God also hates gays and wants you to hate gays. On the other hand, if you love gays and are religious, you convince yourself that your God also loves gays and wants you to love gays.

And why is it wrong to ridicule these incredibly ridiculous beliefs? The teacher has a responsibility to ensure that those students grow up educated and have an ability to critically think for themselves, and part of that responsibility entails challenging these religious views. The classroom is by far the most appropriate place to present this challenge. This idea that religion is off limits in the classroom is doing a real disservice to students that might have the possibility of being freed from their religious ideology.

'Don't let a few bad apples ruin the whole barrel.' newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Here's the problem with that statement, which is correct for traffic stops and the like. The real problem on the police force is that the 'good apples' stay silent when the 'bad apples' abuse their authority and otherwise break the law. There are countless videos out there where a bad apple cop beats up a guy in a wheelchair, beats the shit out of a girl, etc. and the 'good apple' cops stay silent and do nothing to stop the abuse. Later on, the whole force rallies behind the bad apple and nothing ever gets done to punish the cop responsible, or he gets a paid vacation for a week or two until people forget about it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar While true that the vast majority of cops don't commit abuse themselves, too many of them are silent, and allow a culture of abuse to foster itself.

No not slept, I wrote 'exposed to technology as much' and that is true.  Be it from antiquated gender roles, age, or many other factors, the oldest generations have simply not been exposed to as much technology as the generations now.

That was simply not true for my mother and father.   newlinechar  newlinechar It isn't a slam on seniors, it just happened to be when they were born.  Likewise, I would be an utter buffoon on a farm because I was born in a city while at the same time the country itself was no longer nearly as dominated by agriculture as it was at the time of my parents' births.   newlinechar  newlinechar My hypothesis is that CNN is using technology as a curtain to make themselves seem more credible to seniors.

I think the idea is that if who you are (egoistically, psychologically) is more painful in the long run than pleasurable, killing off your identity and trying again from scratch makes more sense than limiting your options to zero(death). In practice, though, this seems to be the main energizing force for cults as well as more mainstream religions. Killing your mind, so to speak, is very difficult and generally seems to require a lot of forceful guidance and mentoring, leaving you open to dangerous manipulation. Then again it could certainly be argued that being (re)brainwashed is better than being dead.

And not only would I defend him, I would applaud him. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;&gt;It seems a strange believe of people today that every opinion is somehow worthy of respect. newlinechar  newlinechar Just to be clear, I don't believe this is true. Religious ideas are NOT worthy of respect by default. But this isn't about respect - it's about limiting the state's powers.
Agreed on the girl. It's not always the case. Girls seem to have that 'it's real not because of logic, but because of feelings' thing more often than guys.

So I finally got my Taurus 24/7 OSS 9mm back from the factory. It took about 2 1/2 months.

Then I'll pull the trigger again, and repeat. Do you think this practice could be harming the weapon? Should I just pull the slide back fully and reinsert the cap? Or, should I just get rid of the snap cap and pull the slide back fully between each trigger pull, hit the slide release, and pull the trigger again, since it really won't hurt the gun?

I've noticed that the 'after=' has the ID of the last story contained in the value, so it's probably there to make sure that the last story on the previous page doesn't appear at the top of the next page.

This is exactly the kind of stuff that should NOT be associated with atheism (or humanism, or whatever.) newlinechar  newlinechar Our guiding philosophy should not be our main source of good feelings / togetherness / well-being, etc. That's not its purpose. This is like expecting a scientific theory to entertain us. I recognize the importance of entertainment, but that doesn't mean everything that's important should also entertain us. newlinechar  newlinechar If a philosophy becomes associated with good feelings, then people who practice it will become reluctant to examine it critically out of fear that they'll lose these good feelings. It's part of why people cling to belief so strongly - they don't want to lose the source of their well-being.

An obvious solution would be to require retaking the driving test at regular intervals for people over a certain age. An eyesight test and something that determines suitability for driving based on coordination/motor skills/reaction time should also be mandatory. It is doubtful that something like this would ever be put in to practice though, due to the elderly's influence over politics and the resources that would be required to expand existing and create new testing centers.

&gt; If you can't figure out a way of talking about meaning within a system, then you need to rethink your definition of meaning. newlinechar  newlinechar Living for the 'experience' of life is shallow and gives no reason, cause, or justification.

What CNN tries to do, and what gets bought by the people who casually watch it, are not the same.

&gt; I believe what I stated in the ellipses was actually quite pertinent to the point. newlinechar  newlinechar It wasn't. Assuming that I understood you correctly when you said, '...when the format of the message itself is compromised' -- i.e., if the attacker has both the algorithm and the hashes -- then the point of the one-way hash, in the context of password security, indeed *was* to keep passwords secure. Well, *more secure*, anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar If it wasn't -- if one-way hashes with salts and all the other goodies didn't afford any extra security, then things like Unix password files wouldn't've gone to the trouble. They've since moved on, using things like shadow files, or in the case of OpenBSD specifically, a separate pwdb, but those tactics just create an extra hurdle for an attacker. The end result is still the same: you hash your passwords. newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to be completely ignoring the part you quoted that says, 'barring of course a brute force attack' ... unless you're one of the unfortunate people that believes that a dictionary attack is, one, feasible given a sane password policy, and two, not a form of brute force attack. newlinechar  newlinechar The only other semi-rational point-of-view you could be coming from is, 'this isn't perfect security, so it's not secure', which is a useless discussion because there's no such thing as perfect security. newlinechar  newlinechar Your metaphor isn't accurate at all, anyway.

I think the quality of the discussion here is vastly more important than the headline; thus if I were a moderator I'd suggest basing moderation decisions (in this reddit only) primarily on the discussion generated rather than on headlines.

No idea if you do that or not, just throwing it out there as an idea.

I don't know if you follow the Israeli press, but it's hardly exceptional for an opinion piece of this sort to appear.  Israeli political discourse has a very wide range.

I think it's apart of confidence and lack thereof, but I tend to create these push/pull relationships when I feel negative about myself. I think about where I should be in life and how I planned things out. Sometimes I don't meet my own expectations because they're (perhaps) too high. I suppose I don't see myself as someone beautiful at these times. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, as a consequence, I start pushing certain things out. I guess I try too hard to win other people's affection and that is where people tend to pull away because it's too easy? Maybe I haven't met the right person who is pushing with me. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know what to think though. After being depressed two other times in my life, I think I've gone through this similar phase in which I started showcasing my talent more and more. More of who I am start appearing and shine through. And maybe it's apart of growing up, but I tend to throw all that away and do even better, greater, and bigger things.

1) I'm betting you do a dozen things everyday that are far more dangerous, and far less necessary, than taking a vaccine that has never been linked to any health problems.

He doesn't have a positive right in this context. As a teacher in a secular public school, he is a representative of the state. The state is restricted with respect to religion - it can't endorse or criticize it.

For about 2 years now, I haven't been able to convince myself that anything is worth doing.  It all started when I went away to grad school, since science was practically, up to that point, my whole life and it seemed like the logical thing to do. After working on topics I didn't care about, I thought it would be better to drop out than to continue passionless research. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I'm stuck in this nihilistic mode where no matter what I think about doing, I manage to convince myself that any activity I would try seems frivolous. The skipping track of my internal record player has been: 'In the grand scheme of things, nothing I do matters.'  It's like the attitude I have with sports; why play the game if it doesn't matter who wins or loses? I have had days where I sit and do nothing else for hours. However, when I read that I'm 'missing out' on life, but it doesn't feel that way, that's when I go from neutral apathy to full-blown depression. newlinechar  newlinechar This isn't to say that I haven't tried the usual remedies to fight it, like exercise, hanging out with friends, etc.  The problem is, that doesn't do anything to solve it, it just puts a pending distraction/task in my head that displaces my apathy. It's when I'm contemplative that I self-destruct.  My blank mind eats me from within, and I can't find a way out besides sleep or death. I can't find the joy in things, how do you?

I sympathise with your and your in-laws' position, but from my experience with the anti-vaxxers (also through in-laws, oddly) the issue is confused beyond the point of specific objections to metals used. To clear up one point, aluminium is a toxic metal in large quanities, but in the quantities used in vaccines it wouldn't even register - you'd get more from walking barefoot in dirt. newlinechar  newlinechar The objections I hear from the crowd I've spoken to about it are doubtful about the effectiveness of vaccines *at all*. There's a large contingent who think that the child's immune system will be sufficiently strengthened by long-term breast feeding (3 years + in some cases) to make immunisations pointless. They were wholly unaware of the implications to the larger population of the vaccination rate dropping below 'critical mass' levels. newlinechar  newlinechar Your in-laws sound like rational, concerned people, but from my experience they are far from typical of the anti-vaccination crowd, who will latch onto any apocryphal story or anecdote to justify their objects to anything coming out of big pharma. The isolated cases (which still have not been linked to vaccines) are dwarfed by the clear and fatal consequences of insufficient immunisation programmes. While I (and any scientifically-minded person) wouldn't object to further research being done, there is no way in hell that it is worth suspending programmes or risking taking your child out of them based on hearsay.

&gt;It's pretty much the same story in other areas - virtually no science-fiction but lots of romances. The branch libraries are no better. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So...  because it's filled with books of a niche genre you don't like, rather than books of a niche genre you DO like, that means it's OK to close it? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In my experience, libraries' collections change in direct response to their patrons.  I'm sorry that you lived in an area where the library was mostly frequented by bored housewives, but that doesn't mean it's suddenly time to shut the library down. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Or do you have some argument for why sci-fi geeks deserve books more than housewives?
No Continential-European or, more specifically, Australian love?
Actually, $20 says you're not that sure...
oh wow.. what happened to all the books?
agreed.  I'm one of the people that outgrew the library.  If it wasn't for a constant stream of library books from the time I could go to the bookmobile in grade-school till I started having to order books at coles, right down to amazon.  If i hadn't had the library I would have withered on the vine. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm that omnivorous now I've had to start fighting book creep, and the library is helping with that.  I just bag up the assorted books and drop them off at the library.  I wonder if they have started to notice that their ranks are starting to swell through no fault of their own.
Each time someone mentions their company I'm compelled to ask this question: Dare to share more info about your business?

I agree about DS9.  I loved that show, and I really enjoyed the more religious and philosophical take on the Star Trek universe that it provided.  Now, after all that, I suppose it makes sense to end the show in some sort of religious way, but in practice, it sucked.  Stupidest ending ever.  God I was pissed.
They are still there, but the stacks are closed so instead of being able to browse the shelves you have to go to the librarian and have them retrieve the book for you.  There is no reading are either, just a desk.

Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do 100 digg ad girls, but take it from this old horn dog, I've spent my entire adult life doing digg ad girls, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. newlinechar  newlinechar If you only train one part of your personality (and that's all a single exercise like training confidence is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for humiliation down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. newlinechar  newlinechar Talking to girls for confidence basically only trains the ego and to some extent, the penis. What you really want to do is train your entire personality, all the major traits (confidence, intelligence, humour) at the same time, over the course of a conversation. And don't forget your 'cardiovascular work'. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with digg ad girls, fapping right, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with digg ad girls if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. newlinechar  newlinechar But do it right, okay? newlinechar  newlinechar My advice, find a good digg ad girl, with large breasts who will challenge you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for humping 100 digg ad girls. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). newlinechar  newlinechar And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you hump a digg ad girl. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar Now get out there and do her! :-)
I liked 'The Man Comes Around' by Johnny Cash. It was a great choice for the opening credits of Dawn of the Dead. It implied that the coming Apocaplyse that Christians believe in would be like a George Romero zombie movie.

They are as much the victims of dogma as anyone else. It's not even that they're ignorant (at least, not in the cases we're talking about). They've been exposed to the arguments and viewpoints of their intellectual opponents, and refuse to be swayed. Something's not clicking. This 'scientific' campaign of fundamentalism is, in most cases, not one of ignorance, naivete, or some kind of personal weakness. There seems to be a fundamental (excuse the adjective) difference between the way they think and the way we think.
Nobody may have gained, but some people certainly lost more than others.  newlinechar Waren Buffett has lost billions, but that doesn't mean he is on the street or hurting to pay his medical bills.  The real people who lose when the system starts to collapse are the poor.  They are hit the hardest.

For instance if it is a stud then its sperm is valuable.   newlinechar  newlinechar Take for instance Barbaro, one of the most bad ass horses in the last decade or two. He broke his foot, made a strong recovery, then a minor set gave him a abscess. Everyone wanted him to live, the vets, the owners, the crowd, but a broken foot is very difficult injury for a horse. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt;but HFCS contains more fructose and less glucose than sugar. newlinechar  newlinechar Not always. HFCS 55 is the most commonly used corn syrup, but HFCS 42 isn't far behind. You have to first prove that the extra 5% makes a significant difference in health before you can definitively say that HFCS 55 is worse for you than sucrose sugar, and if it is worse, than HFCS 42 is better for you than sucrose sugar. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;if HFCS were used the same way we use cane sugar or beat sugar there would be very little problem. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar How is it used differently from sucrose sugar? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The problem is how its used in almost everything people buy that's been processed.  newlinechar  newlinechar Name a classic version of commonly eaten convenience foods, or any foods containing HFCS for that matter, that didn't originally have sugar in their recipes.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Its even used as a preservative in raw meat at the supermarket. newlinechar  newlinechar citation please.

My sisters were driving down a road. One 15 the other 17. While they were going down the road a man in another car hit the front driver side and cause the car to roll several times. My sister who is 15 at the time dies from head trauma. The police found several sets of tabs of H. Enough that at first they told my parents they could put him away for a long time. Well wouldn't you know when it gets time for the case the tabs are gone and the DA ( who's just as crooked as the cops ) doesn't care. A phony trial proceeds and he is given the charge of wreckless endangerment for going too fast.

This would be the argument against the free market.  newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, my rule of thumb is that if it doesn't effect the environment or human health, by all means, it should be completely free market (aside from *some* regulation stopping anti-competitive practices, in such instances as Net Neutrality, for example). In instances of the environment and human health, you'd think the need for regulation would've cropped up around the time that fish became poisonous to eat.

&gt; Value is subjective newlinechar  newlinechar In the micro picture you are perfectly right. newlinechar  newlinechar In the macro picture, value is not that subjective. We all compete for a few basic ingredients to life: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, education, health care, justice. These essentials are traded as a zero sum game, and technological progress only makes the sum larger, and even then it's not clear if the enlargement is permanent, or predicated on the consumption of finite fossil energy resources.

Rails' ORM pattern isn't bad, it's a classic design pattern for an ORM to follow.  It's even named after the design pattern that it implements (Active Record.) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not crazy about migrations.  The implementation offers a lot of good in terms of versioning, but it does so at the expense of laying an often-times oversimplified abstraction over using full SQL syntax (and yes even the vendor specific bits sometimes.) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The more advanced options available for designing a database using a modern RDBMS are not just needless complicated shit that some enterprise douche put in because he's not hip and 'agile' like you.   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of times those features are there for a reason, and can have a serious impact on scalability, maintainability, performance and data integrity. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not crazy about the 'use an autonumber for every primary key in the entire database' thing either, but that's an argument and discussion that's been covered repeatedly all over the internet. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar With all of that said, much of rails is optional.  You *can* make a very strong mission-critical application with Rails.  It's not actually constrained to doing things like writing another rather boring (featurewise) project management web app that has obvious security holes.

I don't think the explanation you give is really convincing. This what the anti TCO crowd says every time somebody shows an example of where TCO is useful, the response is always oh well I don't see why somebody needs that or I don't see how that's a good example. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, I feel the same way about your stack trace argument, I don't feel it's a convincing example, and I think it's contrived.  newlinechar  newlinechar And features aren't the problem with C++ and Perl, it's the hodgepodge syntax that's the issue. Lisp and Scheme have tons of features, yet the syntax is very regular.

Interesting counter argument! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The difference in productivity between the USA and UK/Italy is however still fairly large (almost 20%). Also, the people in the USA are not forced to work more. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; (+ the French actually have the choice because of their labour laws).  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The labour laws are pretty bad for French business (including small business). They have a saying about that: hiring someone is worse than marrying someone. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The USA is also full of smaller businesses (contrary to popular belief). It would be interesting to see what the number of small business owners per capita is when France is compared with the USA. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar There is still another problem I have  – people in Europe are less likely to change jobs or to quit and enter the labour force at a later time (e.g. to raise children or care for an elderly person). Because of the more restrictive laws in Europe, voluntary job mobility is lower than in the USA. It would be interesting to see a statistical comparison between the two. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; For example: Italian stay-home mamas doing housework don't earn a salary, yet they produce services.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar That may be true – but it would be reflected in the spending patterns of the money earner (the creation of wealth would somehow reflect in the GDP). A bigger problem for Italy (specifically) and for Europe in general is its population collapse. To say it simply: Italian stay-home mamas aren't producing children. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It is easy to dismiss a population decline with saying there are already too much people. But an ageing and a declining population can have catastrophic economic and social effects. A newsweek article of a few years ago said a contributing factor is specifically on the difficulty of women to re-enter the labour market after having a child (can't find it now – here is another one related to the topic: http://www.newsweek.com/id/47915). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Now, if you couple this with the income inequality of European countries, you can actually construct an argument of sorts implying that most Europeans are generally materially and opportunity-wise better off than their counterparts across the Atlantic. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It would be interesting to see the income inequality normalized w.r.t. the GDP per capita (since that of the US is higher). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The comparison (IMHO) between Europe and the USA is difficult and complicated. No doubt the USA can be improved (less defence spending and subsidies) but just throwing the USA system into the water (as some suggest) and adopting a European one can't be a good thing. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Anywayz, interesting post.

Let me know the truth.
Fellows, this friday I presented the case for discontinuing all domestics flights to my colleagues in order to reduce our carbon footprint (I argued for train travel only). Opposition was fierce, as was expected. I was met with the argument that our participation in flight travel would make no difference - the flights would still take off, and the emissions would go on irregardless of our abstinence. I go to reddit for advice on how to meet this ignorant argument. In essence I believe that this is the standard argument for egoism and inaction for the individual. Can you help me with some heavy academic artillery? How does the actions of few affect the actions of corporations? Citations from the greatest economic minds would be a great help! I have faith in reddit to help me contribute to a better world - one train-ride at a time.

*That* is exactly the point, they made the product *before* HIV was discovered, and *kept selling it* after HIV was discovered, instead of destroying it and taking the loss. Get it? They sold it *knowing* it was contaminated with HIV virus. newlinechar  newlinechar Why would Bayer do that? Corporate conscience allows cost to be factored against the morality of killing people. You have a million vials and you know some are contaminated. The cost of testing each vial is prohibitive. More cost effective to destroy it all. But wait a second, if you sell it to poor people and you get lucky, only a few of them will become ill and die. Your lawyers pay off the survivors and you still make a profit. And if you keep the secret and the survivors never find out what you did, you make a hell of a profit.

I'm not sure if that was sarcasm, but: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The Bayer company then became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of German chemical industries that formed a part of the financial core of the German Nazi regime. IG Farben owned 42.5% of the company that manufactured Zyklon B[citation needed], a chemical used in the gas chambers of Auschwitz and other extermination camps. During World War II, the company also extensively used slave labor in factories attached to large slave labor camps, notably the sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp[2]. When the Allies split IG Farben into several pieces after World War II for involvement in organized Nazi war crimes, Bayer reappeared as an individual business. The Bayer executive Fritz ter Meer, sentenced to seven years in prison by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal, was made head of the supervisory board of Bayer in 1956, after his release.[3] newlinechar  newlinechar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer#History

I think your sex example, while ridiculous, is precisely analogous. The marriage is over, the trappings of the marriage are gone for one spouse, whether it be sex, cooking, arm-candy, or anything else - it seems unreasonable that the other spouse should get to keep *their* trappings. Hence, if we accept one unreasonable situation, the other is no worse. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I assume it's the wife doing the divorcing? If not, I become more sympathetic.

I guess that would seem really boring to me. Trolling fundies, I mean. Sure, some are nuts and say weird, funny stuff, but they never claimed to use 'reason' in the first place. So, in a way I can't explain briefly here, you're really just validating their beliefs which are based on faith.  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, they reject reason and embrace faith, so wouldn't the lulz come from getting them to 'go off message' somehow by embracing reason? Does that ever happen? Still seems kinda like too easy of a target. If they reject reason, and you try without success to get them to use reason, then who really 'wins'? newlinechar  newlinechar How about playing 'hard mode' for extra internets? Troll a logician, or one of the 'unclear on the concept' atheists. Both of these groups have laid claim to 'reason' and believe it makes them superior thinkers.

Bayer does business internationally but is a German corporation. It must obey American laws only in regards to doing business in America and in shipping *from* America any products made in America. newlinechar  newlinechar You point out that if Ron Paul dismantled the FDA then it would have been necessary for the 50 states to regulate this. Did you read in the article that the FDA (federal) was aware of what Bayer was doing and took no action except to forbid Bayer to sell the contaminated product in the United States, and urge it without commitment or results to end the practice globally? Is that your shining example of your federalism? It was the courage of one man, one FDA employee, that pressured Bayer to stop. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not making a liberatarian issue of this. Nor should you make it an anti-libertarian issue if you read the article because the system *failed.* As is so often true, it was the courage and honor of an individual, not a regulatory agency, but one honorable human being who stopped Bayer. newlinechar  newlinechar I am *not* a Ron Paul Republican. I have known Rep. Paul for many years, like and admire him, but did not support his presidential candidacy.

No, it's not a good idea to have a generic package management framework. newlinechar  newlinechar Packagers (like Debian, for example) have years of experience at collating huge collections of independent software, and guidelines about how to package them so they don't interfere with each other, and so upgrades can be painless and safe. Python developers, no matter how skilled they may be at coding individual applications and libraries, rarely have this experience, so I wouldn't want to install packages they've made onto any system I'm responsible for. newlinechar  newlinechar The other problem is that package management systems generally assume they'll be the only package management system - once you introduce a second one, they can start stomping over one another without noticing, and that's just Not Fun to debug. newlinechar  newlinechar The nicest thing I can say about .egg files is that they're usually pretty easy to turn into .RPM files to install on `$EMPLOYER`'s RHEL servers, or to install by adding them to `$PYTHONPATH`.

Well, the first two points don't address Haskell as a language, but library and naming issues, and you can easily deal with them inside the current Haskell syntax: Redefining (&gt;&gt;=), (.) and ($) is trivial, and an editor with simple refactoring support will be able to re-arrange your code automatically. It's hardly rocket science, but, yes, it hasn't been done, yet. newlinechar  newlinechar The third point can be addressed by providing type signatures for program fragments... I've never looked into it, but I believe such a thing already exists. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And, no, you can't solve Java's problems with an editor, not even with eclipse. Eclipse doesn't get you over 'implements SwissArmyKnife', does fix neither collections nor generics, and doesn't automatically abbreviate identifiers. Last, but certainly not least, it doesn't fix the VM's instruction set.

King of the Hill is definitely different.  It's EXTREMELY subtle, which is in stark contrast to a lot of other stuff Mike Judge has done. newlinechar  newlinechar It's based heavily on character development (like Roseanne . . . I suppose), and I think it's one of those 'it's funny once you get to know the characters' types of shows. newlinechar  newlinechar I have to give credit to the show for having damn-near half a dozen awesomely well-developed characters, in contrast to most shows which have 2 or 3 at most. newlinechar  newlinechar Hank, Bobby, Peggy, Dale, Bill, Kahn, Buck, Cotton, Luanne . . . to a lesser extent Connie, Boomhauer, John Redcorn, Lucky, Nancy, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike shows like Roseanne which focus on relatively topical humor and character interaction, King of the Hill excels at deep but subtle humor derived from extremely consistent and well-developed characters. newlinechar  newlinechar The show isn't half as funny if you don't know the characters.  So, unfortunately (as much as I hate to say it), you really need to get to know the show before it gets really funny, and then you start to fall in love with it. newlinechar  newlinechar I love King of the Hill, and I'm really bummed that it's going away.
